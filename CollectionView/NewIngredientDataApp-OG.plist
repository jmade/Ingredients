			<string>Acrylates are chemical compounds proven to be safe for cosmetic use. They have slightly different functions depending on their composition, but they are predominately used in gel-based products.</string>
			<string>Copolymer compounds create a water-repellent base for products with waterproof qualities. They act by creating a thin flexible film that prevents water washing the product away.</string>
			<string>Ethylene oxide is a key raw material in the production of surfactants and detergents adding to their foaming and skin-conditioning qualities.</string>
			<string>We use this as a base in The Big Tease styling gel. It conditions the hair by coating it with a thin film.</string>

			<string>Hemp, originating in Central Asia, is cultivated for many reasons, but is now grown all over the world for its seeds or oil, for its fibre, and illegally for marijuana.</string>
			<string>Hemp has been used since ancient times in Egypt, China and India to help with digestive problems, to balance hormones, for rheumatism and to promote hair growth.</string>
			<string>Hemp seeds, oil and butter are commonly used today in cooking and preparation of food, as it is full of omegas, magnesium and other essential minerals.</string>
			<string>The ancient Indians used hemp in medicine for healing, and it is still used in traditional Chinese medicine today.</string>
			<string>Hemp fibres are used to make textiles and ropes. The plants cultivated for this reason are approximately 10 feet tall with no branching; plants cultivated for their seeds and oil are smaller and have many branches.</string>
			<string>Hemp oil is cold-pressed from the seeds of the plants and is clear to light green in color. It is analgesic and anti-inflammatory, often used in external medicine to treat varicose veins, corns and sores.</string>
			<string>Our organic hemp oil is obtained from plants grown without any chemicals or unnatural materials.</string>
			<string>We use hemp seed oil in some of our hair products, such as Jasmine and Henna Fluff Ease and Hair Doctor to soothe the scalp.</string>

			<string>Agar Agar comes from a species of seaweeds classed as &apos;agarophytes.&apos; These are found in the seas of Japan, the Mediterranean, Europe, America and Africa.</string>
			<string>They possess fine-fronds, giving them a tufted appearance, which also branch into solid segments. Their colors vary from pinks to deep reds and purples. These colors camouflage their chlorophyll.</string>
			<string>When the seaweeds are collected, they are then laid out on a beach, bleached and dried. To obtain the gel like solution, the seaweed is boiled in water and filtered. This is then dried in the sunlight and prepared into bars, flakes or fine granules. </string>
			<string>Japanese innkeeper, Minoya Tarozaemon, first encountered Agar in 1660. These types of &apos;agarophyte&apos; seaweeds have been cultivated in Japan since 1769.</string>
			<string>Agar has been used as a culture medium for bacteria since the 1880s, when Robert Koch discovered its usefulness. It is used in the food industry, medicine, dentistry and forensics. </string>
			<string>A teaspoon of agar powder will create a jelly from a cup of liquid. This gel is softening and moisturizing for both skin and hair. </string>
			<string>We use agar agar gel in our Retread triple-strength hair conditioner, which holds together the other ingredients to revitalize damaged, colored, frizzy and thick curly hair.</string>
			<string>Seaweeds contain up to twenty times the elements of land plants.</string>
			<string>We suspend clays and exfoliating granules in the gel-like structure of agar for our Love Lettuce Fresh Face Mask. The gel softens the skin, balancing the cleansing action of the other ingredients. </string>
			<string>In the creamy Veganese conditioner, we use the gel for its softening action on the hair follicles. It also acts as a thickening agent in the product.</string>

			<string>There are two types of almond (sweet and bitter), but we use the sweet one. The almond is a fruit and a part of the plum family. The almond tree is a medium-sized tree, native to the Middle East and North Africa. Its white blossom is captivating and beautiful, inspiring many legends.</string>
			<string>Ancient Egyptians valued the almond for cosmetic purposes. The ancient Greeks and Romans used to eat almonds to counter the effect of alcohol.</string>
			<string>When crushed and infused in water, almonds yield lovely milk, which is created as the almond oil combines with the water. Traditionally, almond milk was used as a drink to treat inflammation of the skin from the inside out.</string>
			<string>Our almonds originate in the warmth of California, one of the largest almond growing areas in the world.</string>
			<string>The almonds themselves have to undergo several different processes. They are shelled and sorted into groups of those suitable enough to become oil. They are processed into crude oil and different grades of refined oil are then produced.</string>
			<string>Almond crops are very susceptible to weather, achieving larger quantities in sunny climates. The trees themselves don&apos;t produce almonds for the first three or four years of their lives and will be productive until around twenty-five years. To produce the almonds, the flowers need to be pollinated and many of the producers keep beehives to encourage this.</string>
			<string>Almond milk is excellent when used to soften and moisturize. We use almond milk in our Celestial skin cream for just this purpose; it makes the skin feel beautifully soft and nourished.</string>

			<string>Above a minimum concentration, a surfactant organizes into a structure that can trap the oil-based dirt from the hair, allowing it to be rinsed away. The foam allows the hands to work the shampoo through the hair more easily.</string>
			<string>Sulphates became widely used in the 1930s and they started the development of the modern shampoo industry.</string>
			<string>They are obtained by means of catalytic reduction of fatty acids, such as those in coconut oil and palm kernel oil.</string>

			<string>Thyme is a small evergreen herb that grows low to the ground, up to a height of around 15 inches. It bears white to purple flowers.</string>
			<string>The main constituents of the oil are thymol and carvacrol and it is often used as a disinfectant. It is used in mouthwashes, surgical dressings, and soaps. It is well known for its antiseptic, bactericidal and carminative properties.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is an evergreen shrub, and may grow up to six feet tall. It has green, needle-like leaves and purple flowering tops. It is native to the Mediterranean and belongs to the Labiatae family. Depending on the local climate, it may bloom all year. Rosmarinus officinalis is also known as sea Rose, compass plant and Mary’s tree.</string>
			<string>Leaves and flowering tops are collected in spring and early summer. They are distilled for oil, or dried for infusions, decoctions, extracts, spirits, and tinctures. It is rich in volatile oils, flavonoids and phenolic acids, which are antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. Externally, it is used to help relax muscles, and for dandruff. Rosemary is used on the hair and skin and in bath products.</string>
			<string>Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) is a small tree belonging to the myrtle (Myrtaceae) family and it is native to Australasia. Tea tree oil is made up of around 100 substances, including terpenes, mostly considered to be responsible for tea tree oil’s reputation as a remedy. The oil has been scientifically proven to be antibacterial, antifungal and particularly effective against the types of fungi we call yeasts.</string>
			<string>The aboriginal tribes had been using the leaves of this plant as a medicinal tea and traditional remedy for years. The foliage contains an abundance of aromatic essential oils. Some of the paperbark varieties are exploited commercially for the high germicidal value of the leaves and oil extracted from them.</string>
			<string>To make our thyme, rosemary and tea tree infusion, we add the ingredients to boiled water. We then strain the mixture and add it to our lovely products.</string>
			<string>We use the infusion to keep the skin clear in our Grease Lightning spot treatment.</string>

			<string>Cream of tartar is a byproduct of the winemaking industry. During fermentation, a sediment forms on the inside of the barrels, containing tartaric acid. These are crystals of argolis. These are ground, purified, dried, and reground to produce cream of tartar.</string>
			<string>Cream of tartar in our Bubble Bars helps to give those fantastically frothy, Hollywood-style bubbles.</string>
			<string>We use cream of tartar, sodium bicarbonate in combination with a shampoo base to form a versatile paste.</string>
			<string>This paste can be used to make an endless variety of different shapes.</string>
			<string>We are able to add to the bubble bar paste softening ingredients for the skin - such as coconut milk powder, essential oils and solid bath melt mixture - plus colour and fragrance.</string>
			<string>For a final flourish, we often finish them with extravagant decorations.</string>
			<string>Cream of tartar and sodium bicarbonate are the constituents of baking powder. In baking, they create an aerated texture. In water, this releases carbon dioxide, creating the lightness of texture in the product.</string>
			<string>We use cream of tartar with sodium bicarbonate to make our exclusive (and highly innovative) Bubble Bars. It is used in Blue Skies, The Comforter, Amandopondo, Creamy Candy, Sunny Side, French Kiss, Karma and Pop in the Bath.</string>

			<string>There are two types of almond, sweet and bitter. We use sweet almonds to make sweet almond oil, and bitter almonds to make almond essential oil. The almond is part of the plum family. Botanically, they are a drupe and an ancient ancestor of large-stoned fruits, such as apricots, peaches and plums.</string>
			<string>The bitter almond tree is a medium-sized tree with pink blossoms. It is native to the Middle East and North Africa, but now grown in the Mediterranean and California.</string>
			<string>Almond essential oil is also known as natural benzaldehyde because the finished perfume material is made up of around 99% of it; bitter almond oil is distilled from the kernels of apricots and bitter almonds.</string>
			<string>Sweet almonds and bitter almonds are related, but the key difference between the two is the absence of amygdalin from the former. Amygdalin is used to make cyanide. The final essential oil is not dangerous, but the distillation of it is very involved, as cyanide gas is released during the process. This is neutralized during the process and no trace of it is left in the oil.</string>
			<string>Almond oil is unscented and excellent for the skin. It is emollient, demulcent and nutritious with a high vitamin E content. It is smooth to apply and leaves a silky feel to the skin. When applied to hair, it adds shine and softens the entire hair shaft. </string>
			<string>Ancient Greeks and Romans used almonds to counter the effects of alcohol; Egyptians used almonds for cosmetic purposes.</string>
			<string>We use almond oil in our Charity Pot to protect your skin and leave it silky smooth. </string>
			<string>For its emollient and moisturizing properties, we use almond oil across our entire range, including: You’ve Been Mangoed, Prince Triple Blossom, Love Lettuce, Celestial and our Fair Trade Foot Lotion.</string>

			<string>Aloe Vera is a desert plant that belongs to the lily family. It grows well in dry soils and is native to East and South Africa. The fleshy leaves are sharp and serrated with white spikes; they contain a clear gel harvested for its healing properties.</string>
			<string>Aloe is thought to be one of the oldest remedies, noted for its beneficial qualities in Egyptian, Roman, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Algerian, Moroccan, Arabian, Indian and Christian history. Cleopatra is known to have massaged it into her skin and it appears in Anglo Saxon medical texts, having been brought to Europe in the 10th century.</string>
			<string>In modern times, aloe was found to be more effective than any other method in the treatment of radiation burns.</string>
			<string>Aloe soothes itching and reduces redness; it is excellent in calming sunburn or redness caused by the cold. It softens the skin and helps to protect it.</string>
			<string>We use the gel from the aloe leaf dried, and then add it to water to obtain its original strength. This is a very effective ingredient for cooling and soothing the skin. It is particularly good in after sun products. The skin is cooled and redness fades away.</string>
			<string>Aloe gel is excellent for all skin types, soothing and re-hydrating dry skin, and it is used in our Aqua Marina cleanser.</string>
			<string>Our Breath Of Fresh Air toner contains aloe vera gel. It is a soothing, gentle spray, which both cools and cares for the skin.</string>

			<string>Apple is the most popular and widely cultivated temperate-zone fruit tree. It belongs in the Rosaceae family and is thought to have originated in Western Asia and Asia Minor, where carbonized apples dating from 6500 B.C. have been found. Apples have been cultivated for at least 3,000 years and thousands of varieties now grow around the world.</string>
			<string>The trees produce white or pink flowers and their fruits vary from bright red to yellowish green. The fruits of most varieties are edible. Their textures can be crisp, tender or floury and flavours range from tart to sweet.</string>
			<string>The Romans introduced apples to Europe and spread knowledge of their use to local people. During the Roman conquest of Britain, officers planted apple orchards inside their walled gardens. Eventually, apple trees spread to native villages and became well established.</string>
			<string>John Chapman, a preacher and nurseryman, was responsible for greatly influencing the spread of apple cultivation in America. Within his lifetime, he became the legendary ‘Johnny Appleseed’ due to the volume of nurseries he planted and the seeds he gave away. Apples are now inseparably linked with American culture, giving rise to the famous adage, “as American as apple pie.”</string>
			<string>Today, the largest exporters are France, Italy, Hungary, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, and the United States.</string>
			<string>From Adam and Eve to Greek mythology, apples have featured in the legends of many countries, both as a delicious fruit and a symbolic representation of temptation.</string>
			<string>Apple juice is squeezed from fresh fruit and added to our products immediately. In combination with cleansing ingredients, the juice de-greases the skin with its gently astringent, acidic properties.</string>
			<string>Skin softening ingredients in the product ensure the skin is left soft, clean and refreshed. We use cartons of apple juice when making some of our soaps.</string>
			<string>We use apple juice in Temptation soap from our Retro Range, and we use the organic variety in Demon in the Dark soap, too.</string>

			<string>Arame seaweed is a type of kelp. It is harvested in Japan, Peru and the North Pacific Coast.</string>
			<string>Its blades become wide leaves of up to a foot in length. They are sliced into long strands, cooked, and then left to dry in the sun.</string>
			<string>Seaweeds contain up to twenty times the levels of elements found in land plants. Their mineral content can include calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium and zinc. They are also rich in vitamins.</string>

			<string>The tree is a member of the Laurel (Lauraceae) family and there are approximately 500 varieties, which produce fruits ranging from small and egg-like to heavy, pear-shaped fruits.</string>
			<string>Avocados are very nutritious and full of oil. Avocado butter is produced from the rich flesh of the fruit. It melts with ease, making it effective for skin and hair care products.</string>
			<string>The fruit contains unsaturated oil that rehydrates skin. The oil soothes the upper layers of skin and is very good for dry, cracked, aging and peeling skin.</string>
			<string>Avocado oil is reputed to be beneficial in reducing age spots and the appearance of scars. It is recommended for fine lines and wrinkles, and said to help protect skin from the effects of ultraviolet rays.</string>
			<string>Unruly or dry hair will benefit from avocado butter, as it is rich, nourishing, and softening. We use it in our Curly Wurly shampoo to help add strength, shine and condition to the hair.</string>

			<string>The Aztecs believed the avocado had aphrodisiac qualities because of its shape.</string>
			<string>The name avocado is derived from the Mexican name ‘ahuacatl,’ a shortening of the Aztec name ‘ahuacacuahatl.’</string>
			<string>Cold Cold-pressing the flesh of the avocado makes avocado oil. It takes ten fruits to produce one teaspoon of the rich and thick oil. This oil absorbs easily and it is full of beneficial fatty acids and vitamins.</string>
			<string>Avocado contains more than 20% essential unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins A, B, C and E, proteins, lecithin and potassium (the latter of which is sometimes called the ‘youth mineral’).</string>
			<string>In the US, avocado oil is patented as a treatment for some forms of dermatitis and arthritis. It is reported that long-term treatment with avocado oil can help to relieve eczema.</string>
			<string>Avocado oil is reputed to be beneficial in reducing age spots and the appearance of scars because it has a high content of unsaponifiables (sterolins) that soften and moisturize skin’s upper layer.</string>

			<string>Vinegars formed an important part of ancient hair rinses and skin treatments. We&apos;ve used various types of vinegars across a range of our products. Balsamic vinegar is usually found in our hair care.</string>
			<string>Balsamic vinegar is a staple of Italian cooking and it&apos;s used in ways we might recognize (in salad dressings; to marinade fish and meat dishes) and in ways we might not - such as drizzled on ice cream or on fresh strawberries to enhance their flavour! </string>
			<string>Using various vinegars for cosmetic purposes goes back centuries - vinegars are highly acidic and help to preserve natural cosmetics.</string>
			<string>Vinegars characteristically taste very sour; however, balsamic vinegar is distinctively different with a rich, sweet/sour flavour and thicker, syrupy consistency.</string>
			<string>Balsamic vinegar is prepared from white grapes and wine vinegar. It is placed in wooden barrels and aged for up to 25 years. Each variety gains some flavour from the type of wood used for barrels.</string>
			<string>The traditional method of production originated in Italy and has been used there for centuries. Makers of traditional balsamic vinegar are as protective about the status of the true aged varieties as you would expect a wine grower to be about the character of a good vintage.</string>
			<string>Balsamic vinegar in our H’Suan Wen Hua hair treatment gives hair a glossy shine and a soft texture. This is due to the acid nature of vinegar, which smoothes down the cuticles on the hair shaft allowing light to be reflected evenly. Balsamic vinegar has a resinous, syrupy quality that conditions hair even more than other vinegars.</string>

			<string>There are over 300 species, some of which can reach heights of 40 metres. It grows rapidly, sometimes up to 10 centimetres per day.</string>
			<string>Ancient Chinese bridge and boat-builders favoured bamboo and the plant remains important in Asia. It is used to make household items and used instead of wood as a building material.</string>
			<string>The shoots are edible and are popular in Asian cuisine. They taste a little bit like sweet corn, but take on the flavour of whatever else is in the dish.</string>
			<string>The giant panda lives almost entirely on a bamboo diet!</string>
			<string>Bamboo has been used for many conditions in traditional Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicines.</string>

			<string>Beeswax is the substance that forms the structure of a honeycomb. Bees convert nectar into wax, building honeycomb to store their honey. Ten pounds of honey produces one pound of wax. It has a honey-like aroma and can be distilled into a fragrance.</string>
			<string>Like the honey it houses, beeswax has therapeutic properties of great interest to us. It is said to be particularly effective in healing bruises, inflammation and burns.</string>
			<string>Beeswax gives a rich emollient quality to creams, which is very useful for dry skin. Deeply moisturizing, it also creates a waterproof barrier on the skin.</string>
			<string>It was part of the first cosmetic cream, created by Greek physician, Galen, in 150AD. The cream consisted of beeswax and olive oil with water (or rose water) beaten into it. Because it cooled the skin, it was dubbed ‘cold cream,’ but it also softened and moisturized, too.</string>
			<string>Oil and water combined, like in Galen’s cold cream, helps to preserve the moisture of the skin better than pure oils. We use beeswax in our Ultrabland cleanser; the moisturizing properties of the wax works in combination with essential oils and water to remove excess dirt and dead skin cells to thoroughly and gently deep cleanse the skin.</string>
			<string>We use beeswax in a honeycomb shape to top our Honey I Washed The Kids soap to both decorate and for its moisturizing properties. In combination with essential oils in the product, it will react with the water when you wash your hands and remove excess dirt.</string>
			<string>We’ve added beeswax to our range of lip balms, Honey Trap, Whipstick and Lip Service. Its emollient properties help create a protective barrier and moisturize the lips.</string>

			<string>Benzoin (Styrax benzoin) belongs to the Styraceae plant family. It is extracted from tender, evergreen trees of 25 feet in height, where the resin collects in small incisions made in the bark. These trees are found in the rich woodland and swamps of Sumatra and around the world in places such as Thailand and Java.</string>
			<string>The hardened gum is stored in pieces, also known as ‘tears,’ or pressed into blocks. This gum is then refined further, through the method of solvent extraction, to produce a resinoid or gum, which is then used in perfumery.</string>
			<string>The two main chemical constituents of benzoin are coniferyl cinnamate, an ester, and sumaresinolic acid. Esters are said to have powerful relaxing properties on the skin, and benzoin is commonly used to calm irritation in cracked, sore, and very dry skin conditions. We use benzoin resinoid in our Curly Wurly shampoo to soothe the scalp and to give hair a glossy shine.</string>
			<string>Benzoin is best known for its sweet, balsamic, vanilla and ice cream-like essence. We use it in our American Cream solid perfume for its sweet scent and as a fixative, allowing the perfume to last on the skin.</string>
			<string>Benzoin is also used for its warming qualities, believed to stimulate blood flow and ease aching muscles. We use benzoin resinoid in our Shimmy Shimmy glitter bar, which is massaged on to relax the muscles and to give a lasting perfume.</string>
			<string>It has been used for many years as an ingredient of incense, to help reduce stress and for its antibacterial properties. We make good use of the antibacterial properties of benzoin resinoid in our Greeench and Coconut deodorant powders.</string>
			<string>Acids are very rarely found in essential oils and are said to have strong anti-inflammatory properties, which help towards soothing skin irritation and swelling. These relaxing and soothing properties have also been thought to work on the mind and emotions.</string>
			<string>Benzoin is a natural preservative and an antiseptic. Due to its resinous nature, Benzoin benzoin provides a protective film on the skin and hair, which prevents it from losing moisture and gives hair shine. We use benzoin resinoid in our American Cream, Coolaulin, and Veganese hair conditioners for increased shine.</string>
			<string>Benzoin has been used for thousands of years as a medicine for various conditions, especially on the skin, and in incense to ‘drive away’ evil spirits. It was also used through inhalation to help with respiratory problems.</string>
			<string>We use benzoin resinoid as a fixative and a natural preservative in our perfumes.</string>

			<string>Bergamot is citrus oil obtained from the peel by cold expression. The fruit looks similar to a small orange. Bergamot’s flavour is best known as the predominant ingredient in Earl Grey tea. It is also used to flavour local cakes and beverages in Southern Italy and Sicily.</string>
			<string>Bergamot derives its name from a small town in Northern Italy called Bergamo. We use bergaptene-free bergamot oil; bergaptene is phototoxic and can permanently discolor the skin when exposed to sunlight.</string>
			<string>In the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, ladies using bergamot fragrances were unfortunately left with a permanent ‘pearl-necklace.’</string>
			<string>Its uplifting properties are widely known; it can be very refreshing and has very relaxing properties. It has a light, fruity and floral fragrance. Its fresh and light fragrance makes it a natural anti-depressant. It is thought to clear the mind of anxious thoughts and help to give mental clarity.</string>

			<string>Native to Asia, this woody plant climbs as high as 20 feet in the wild, with spikes containing up to sixty berries. These are harvested, unripe, at full size, and dried in the sun to develop both flavour and colour. The blackening occurs due to enzymes in the berries and the outer surface becomes wrinkled.</string>
			<string>Pepper has been among the most important spices used around the world for thousands of years. Initially, it was used medicinally and later added to food for its flavour. Black pepper has a distinctive aroma and an intense taste.</string>
			<string>Pepper was considered precious in medieval Europe.</string>
			<string>Historically, pepper was valued to aid digestion and cause sneezing. Clinical trials have shown that the main constituent, piperine, acts as an anti-inflammatory, inhibits parasites and can protect the liver.</string>
			<string>The oil is extracted from the berries of this plant by the method of steam distillation. It is usually colourless to pale green and has a spicy and sharp peppercorn smell. It is warming with stimulant properties. It can be an irritant in large quantities, so our inventors use it with great care.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists recommend black pepper oil for headaches, poor circulation, aching muscles, as a natural pain reliever and to combat mental fatigue.</string>
			<string>We use it in our Breath of God atomizer for the radiating potency of the oil. </string>

			<string>Candelilla wax is a hard and brittle wax extracted from the wax-coated stems of Candelilla shrubs (usually from the plant Euphorbia cerifera, syn. Euphorbia antisyphilitica). The plant grows wild in North-eastern Mexico and the plains and foothills of the Chihuahua desert. </string>
			<string>The plant has traditionally been harvested from the wild to extract the thick wax coating, originally used to make candles, giving candelilla its name ‘little candle.’</string>
			<string>Mass production for commercial uses began in Mexico in the early 20th century. World War One increased the demand for this wax because it was used to waterproof military equipment and tents.</string>
			<string>Commercial uses for candelilla wax include polishes, candles, lubricants, paper waterproofing and cosmetics. It is often used to replace other waxes, to add texture, or to help make barrier products, such as lip balms.</string>
			<string>Compatible with most waxes and a variety of other ingredients, it is a versatile and valuable substance.</string>
			<string>One of the most exciting uses for LUSH is that candelilla wax can substitute beeswax, helping us to make our products conform to vegan requirements.</string>
			<string>Candelilla may be found in lip products, moisturizers and massage bars. It can act as an agent preventing moisture loss, as a barrier, to give substance and to enhance the texture of a formula.</string>
			<string>Rowena, LUSH founder and product inventor, recently invented a new way of using candelilla wax; she combined it with jojoba oil to create Ultrabalm; a petroleum jelly-like occlusive substance, ideal for use in any circumstance where a barrier cream or a protective, cushioning texture is required.</string>

			<string>Cardamom is part of the ginger family, native to Ceylon and India. It is a leafy-stemmed shrub reaching up to eighteen feet in height. Its flowers are pale yellow with mauve tips. The fruits contain many seeds and are gathered before they are ripe.</string>
			<string>The fruits are dried slowly to prevent them from bursting open and losing their seeds. The seeds are used whole or ground. An essential oil is distilled from them, which can be colourless or yellow. The scent of the oil is sweet, spicy and almost balsamic.</string>
			<string>It is the world&apos;s third most expensive spice after saffron and vanilla. Cardamom was first mentioned as a medicinal plant in China around AD720. It has been widely used in Chinese and Indian medicine for thousands of years.</string>
			<string>The aphrodisiac properties of cardamom are mentioned in Arabian Nights and it is said to have grown in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The ancient Egyptians chewed it to whiten their teeth, and in ancient Greek culture it was used as an offering to the Gods.</string>
			<string>The Vikings brought this exotic spice back to their homeland after visits to the spice centres of the East. Today, Arab countries are the largest consumers as they use Cardamom in their ‘gahwa’ coffee.</string>
			<string>Cardamom is warming, aromatic, tonic and stimulant. In aromatherapy, it can be used to relax tired muscles and its reviving aroma refreshes the spirits. It can be warming and relaxing on tired joints.</string>
			<string>Cardamom is antiseptic and astringent and can therefore have a tightening and toning effect on the skin.</string>
			<string>It is believed, in the East, that cardamom can stimulate the mind and bring clarity and joy to the senses. The strong, intensely warm, fresh aroma is like a breath of fresh air, opening up the eyes and clearing the mind. It is said to be a spicy and sensual aphrodisiac.</string>
			<string>Cardamom essential oil is effective in products for stimulating, aromatic massage and to flavour lip balm. It is lovely combined with other spicy or aromatic essential oils, such as ginger.</string>

			<string>In the south of France, Acacia farnesiana is cultivated for the perfume industry. The flowers are well known and highly esteemed for the perfume oil they yield. The flowers are globular and golden with a scent of violet and orange blossom. The odor is both spicy and floral.</string>
			<string>The bark and pods yield a black dye; the seeds are pressed for cooking oil.</string>
			<string>The trees usually start to flower after three years of growth and a mature tree produces about 1kg of flowers per season. Cassie absolute is processed from the flowers.</string>
			<string>We use it our Karma fine fragrance and product perfumes.</string>

			<string>Castor oil is derived from the seed of the Ricinus communis plant. It is well tolerated by the skin and used as carrier oil, skin conditioning agent and an emulsion stabilizer in cosmetics.</string>
			<string>The evergreen castor bean shrub is considered native to eastern Africa. It is cultivated in southern Asia, Africa and other hot parts of the world. The seeds are collected when almost ripe and allowed to mature in the sun.</string>
			<string>It is mainly made up of ricinoleic acid; the oil is produced by cold-pressing the seeds and goes through a clarification process by heat before use. The seeds contain ricin, which is poisonous, but it does not absorb into the expressed oil. The oil is a colourless, odorless and tasteless pale yellow liquid.</string>
			<string>Castor oil and its derivatives are widely used in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, waxes, nylons, pharmaceuticals and perfumes, amongst others.</string>
			<string>The oil also contains undecylenic acid, which is a powerful answer to dermal fungus. In 1961, in the journal of American Oil Chemists’ Society, A.F. Novak documented the antimicrobial properties of the two main derivatives of castor oil: ricinoleic and oleic acids. He found that these two substances were superior in their activity against several species of bacteria, yeasts and moulds.</string>
			<string>Traditional uses of castor oil include the treatment of skin problems, burns, sunburns, skin disorders, skin cuts, and abrasions. It has also been used to draw out sties in the eye by pouring a small amount and allowing it to circulate around the inside of the eyelid. The oil has similarly been used in a soaked flannel and placed on the body to cure various ailments, such as headaches, muscle pains, and skin complaints.</string>
			<string>Vegetable oils are favourable alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants due to their emollient property and biodegradability. Castor oil has better high temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it ideal for use in cosmetics.</string>
			<string>Castor oil has been used medicinally around the world for 4,000 years and is featured in Indian and Chinese herbalism.</string>

			<string>Cetearyl alcohol is a white, waxy, solid material in the form of flakes. It is oil soluble, but it is not water-soluble. It is a mixture of fatty alcohols.</string>
			<string>An alcohol in this sense is not a fermented mixture; it is a chemical compound of a certain molecular structure based on carbon and oxygen.</string>
			<string>Fatty alcohols were originally prepared from fats and oils by hydrolysis, which produces fatty acids. These were then hydrogenated to form fatty alcohols. More efficient forms of hydrogenation enable fatty alcohols to be formed directly from triglycerides (vegetable oils).</string>
			<string>Cetearyl alcohol is a wonderful emulsifier. In creams and lotions, it supports the main emulsion system and gives texture to the product. In conditioners, it creates a thickening effect. We use it about 1%.</string>
			<string>Cetearyl alcohol in combination with other ingredients in the formula (such as triethanolamine and stearic acid) forms an emulsion. This stops the oil and water from separating.</string>
			<string>In our creams, the emulsion system is very important. We consider the naturally occurring levels of materials, such as fatty acids, which are in the cocoa and shea butters, when we are deciding on how to balance the formula. The optimum level of cetearyl alcohol is then decided.</string>
			<string>If emulsified excessively, a cream will sit on the surface of the skin and will not be effective. Our creams and lotions are gently held together by this combination of materials. They break down easily when applied to allow the lovely ingredients to benefit the skin.</string>
			<string>For thirty years, we have used this emulsion system in our creams and lotions. Our skin care products are loved and appreciated worldwide for their effective skin softening qualities.</string>
			<string>We use cetearyl alcohol in our innovative Jungle solid conditioner. Its emulsifying quality enables effective fresh ingredients to be emulsified with softening cocoa butter and soya lecithin. The result is an effective product, which detangles the hair, leaving it with shine and excellent condition.</string>
			<string>Cetearyl alcohol is used across our entire range of fresh products as an emulsifier; we use it in everything from our Gorgeous, Imperialis and Celestial facial moisturizers, to our Whipstick and Honey Trap lip balms.</string>

			<string>The most commonly used varieties of chamomile are Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) and German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla, syn. M. recutita). Though we do use both, we favour the German variety, known as chamomile blue and scented mayweed.</string>
			<string>It is a sweetly scented annual or biennial with branched stems and finely divided leaves. Daisy-like flowers are produced from early summer to autumn. Flowers are collected when first fully opened and used in many ways.</string>
			<string>The oil is extracted by steam distillation. It is strikingly blue. This blue colour is due to chamazulene, its main constituent. The vibrancy of the blue hue is an indicator of the oil’s freshness - the older the oil, the greener it becomes.</string>
			<string>Chamomile is one of the gentlest essential oils, making it suitable for children. It is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, bactericidal and sedative.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists have used it to treat bruises, allergies, stress and depression. It is helpful for sensitive skins. It is used in aromatherapy to help hormone fluctuations and to ease period pains.</string>
			<string>Chamomile can be used as an alternative to lavender, but works well with it in blends.</string>
			<string>Many believe it to be calming for the mind, body and soul, soothing for both the emotions and the skin. It is referred to as ‘the oil for everything.’</string>
			<string>Chamomile oil is also used to soothe, irritated scalp conditions in our shampoos and hair products. We use chamomile oil in our Marilyn hair treatment for blonde hair to calm the scalp and to cleanse and brighten the hair.</string>

			<string>In ancient Egypt, the demand for cinnamon and black pepper helped to begin the ancient spice trade, and thus, greater exploration of the world. By the first century A.D., cinnamon was being transported 4500 miles across the sea from Malaysia and Indonesia to the Red Sea. It was highly valued by many and used as a perfume, medicine, preservative and flavouring spice. Many myths surrounded its origin at that time, to protect its source and the great wealth its trade generated.</string>
			<string>Cinnamon quills, according to legends, were used to make the nest of the mythical phoenix. The birds carried them to high mountain precipices and as the quills fell to the ground, they were collected and sold.</string>
			<string>Today, cinnamon is used as flavoring for foods, including pickles, cakes, sweets, cola-type soft drinks, ice cream and liqueurs. It has also found its way into oral hygiene products and cosmetics.</string>
			<string>Cinnamon has a fragrant, spicy, intensely warming and slightly sweet flavor. It is loved in mulled wine, puddings, pastries and curries. A good cleansing herb, it also has powerful antiseptic properties. Its sensual aroma has been proven to have an aphrodisiac effect when used in baked cinnamon rolls!</string>
			<string>Finely grinding the quills gives us the rich cinnamon powder. &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Essential oils are distilled from the leaves and bark of the cinnamon tree. We use cinnamon leaf essential oil in fragrances to warm the body and soothe the senses. Its stimulating effect tightens the skin and increases the circulation. It is excellent for exhaustion as its warming scent relaxes the body and lifts the spirit. Cinnamon bark essential oil has a deeper, richer note than cinnamon Leaf. It is used very sparingly, as it is much more powerful.</string>
			<string>Essential oils from cinnamon have very powerful antiseptic and antimicrobial effects. Cinnamon leaf essential oil can be used in products to help protect them from bacterial growth when no synthetic preservative is present. This antiseptic effect is very effective for the skin of the feet; the action controls bacteria on the skin, the breakdown of which causes odor.</string>

			<string>Citric acid is a naturally occurring fruit acid.In lemons and limes, it can account for up to 8% of the dry weight.</string>
			<string>We source citric acid from Europe.</string>
			<string>Our citric acid is produced from non-genetically modified sugar beet or molasses. The molasses are crushed, mixed with lime and stacked in trays; the mix is then sprayed with a natural mould spore, allowing the fermenting mix to turn grey and fuzzy, eventually becoming citric acid.</string>
			<string>It is a white crystalline powder, which is odorless and tastes very acidic.</string>
			<string>Alchemists were aware of the acid as early as 700AD. It was first isolated in 1784 (from crystallized lemon juice) by Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele.</string>
			<string>It was first mass-produced on an industrial scale in 1860 as a by-product of the Italian citrus fruit industry. In 1893, it was discovered that penicilium mould could be used to help produce the acid by means of fermenting carbohydrates. In 1917, aspergillus niger was used, thereby leading to today’s commonly used process.</string>
			<string>We are the proud inventors of the ‘Bath Bomb.’ We combine citric acid with sodium bicarbonate to form the basis of our explosive Bath Bombs. When added to the water, this creates carbon dioxide and causes a bubbling, fizzing action. Many colors, fragrances, essential oils, flowers and herbs can be added to make uniquely fragrant Bath Bomb. As they break down in the water, the effect of the essential oils is heightened.</string>
			<string>We use citric acid across our entire range of Bath Bombs, from the sensual Sex Bomb, Big Blue, Avobath, Vanilla Fountain to the heavenly Honey Bee.</string>
			<string>We use citric acid in our indulgent bath melts MMM Melting Marshmallow Moment and Floating Island.</string>

			<string>The clove is a tropical evergreen tree of the myrtle (Myrtaceae) family. The cultivation of clove trees has existed for at least 2000 years. The tree can grow to be 90 years old and may yield 800lbs to 1,000lbs of cloves per year.</string>
			<string>The familiar clove buds are the dried, aromatic flowers of the tree. They are picked before the pink blossoms open and dried for 48 hours in the sun, becoming brown in the process.</string>
			<string>Clove leaf oil is extracted from the leaves and twigs, which are harvested once a year by distillation. This produces a yellow to brown oil with a woody, warm and spicy sweet aroma.</string>
			<string>Our clove leaf oil is from Madagascar and is antiseptic, stimulating and boosts circulation.</string>
			<string>The main constituent of the oil is eugenol. Clove leaf oil possesses analgesic (pain-relieving) properties.</string>
			<string>Isolate sugenol is used in pharmaceutical and dental preparations and is used today to fight toothache, mouth ulcers and infections.</string>

			<string>Cocamide MEA is a thick, waxy and white substance derived from coconut oil. Coconut oil is rich in fatty acids.</string>
			<string>Cocamide MEA is similar in its properties to cocamide DEA, and these are both surface active agents (surfactants). MEA is used when its thickening qualities and opaque nature are required.</string>
			<string>Cocamide MEA and DEA support the action of the main surfactants in a shampoo, shower gel or any foaming cleansing product.</string>
			<string>All surfactants are partly water-soluble and partly oil-soluble. Above minimum concentration, the surfactant molecules organize into a structure that can trap oil-based dirt from hair, allowing it to be rinsed away. Foam is not responsible for removing dirt, but it allows the hands to work shampoo through the hair. This helps the mechanical removal of grease.</string>
			<string>Modern surfactants give a thick, rich foam and cleanse the hair, dissolving grease effectively. As a result, your hair is left in great condition, full of body and shine.</string>
			<string>We use cocamide MEA in our thicker shampoos - Rehab, I Love Juicy and Daddyo – to cleanse and revive lifeless hair.</string>

			<string>The cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) is native to tropical America and grows to approximately 30 feet tall. It begins to bear fruit in its fourth year. The ripe, dark reddish-brown pods yield 20-50 seeds, which are known as cocoa beans.</string>
			<string>It is to the Aztecs that we owe our knowledge of the marvellous Cacao tree. They roasted the beans from the trees in pots and crushed them between stones to form a paste. This paste was then diluted with water and spiced with annatto, anise seeds, red peppers and cinnamon. The mixture was beaten and stirred slowly over a fire until it became a bubbling liquid. This was truly a food of the Gods as the name ‘Theobroma’ suggests. The Greek ‘theos’ means ‘god’ and ‘broma’ means food – hence ‘Food of the Gods.’</string>
			<string>Cocoa absolute is extracted by solvent extraction. The absolute is very thick and dark brown, and it has a rich, dark chocolate aroma.</string>
			<string>Cocoa absolute is one of the more difficult materials to blend and requires heating before use.</string>
			<string>We use it in our product perfumes, flavors and fine fragrances.</string>
			<string>It is cultivated all over the world in China, Africa, Brazil and Guatemala and many others.</string>
			<string>We use many ingredients derived from the cocoa bean because they are so beneficial and inspiring. Cocoa butter forms the base of our massage bars and many of our emulsions, for example, and our Cupcake Fresh Face Mask wouldn’t be the same without cocoa powder.</string>

			<string>The cacao tree (Theobroma cacao – ‘the food of the gods’) is native to tropical America and can grow up to approximately thirty feet tall. The tree yields fruit in its fourth year in the form of dark red or brown pods. These pods, in turn, yield up to fifty seeds.</string>
			<string>To make cocoa butter, these seeds are fermented, which removes their bitterness. They are then cleaned, roasted and cracked to remove their hard shells. These &apos;cocoa nibs&apos; are ground to a thick, oily paste called chocolate liquor.</string>
			<string>The fat removed from the liquor goes through high pressure to separate the cocoa butter and cocoa powder. The butter is more than 50 % of the cocoa bean. It is rendered into pale yellow cocoa butter. Unlike most fats, the butter is not greasy. It has a hard consistency and smells like chocolate.</string>
			<string>We owe our knowledge of cocoa to the Aztecs. They created the original form of hot chocolate, which was a fiery, chocolate drink.</string>
			<string>The butter is a natural emulsifier and softening for the skin. It is said to effectively relieve itchy, dry skin when applied topically. We use it across our entire range of products for its softening, moisturizing and conditioning properties.</string>
			<string>Cocoa butter is a stable and dry butter. It can be used in combination with other natural butters to create rich blends. In our massage bars, including Wiccy Magic Muscles, Therapy, Heavanilli and Strawberry Feels Forever, cocoa butter works with the other natural ingredients, reacts to the temperature of the body and melts over the skin, making it supple and smooth.</string>
			<string>We use cocoa butter in our luxury bath melts, Floating Island, MMM Melting Marshmallow Moment and You’ve Been Mangoed. As they melt in the hot water, the butter disperses and your bath becomes a decadent treat, softening your skin and hair.</string>
			<string>Our body butters contain a generous helping of this delicious butter. In Buffy, the cocoa and shea butters soften and nourish the skin, while the ground rice, aduki beans and almonds exfoliate and scrub away dead cells.</string>

			<string>Vaccinium is the Latin name for the blue berry family. Vacca means cow, and cows are attracted to this plant. Macrocarpon relates to large fruits or seed pods.</string>
			<string>The cranberry is a small evergreen shrub native to bogs and swamps across America. The berries are green when they first appear and turn red as they ripen.</string>
			<string>We buy our dried cranberries from USA.</string>
			<string>Cranberries contain benzoic acid, which acts as a natural preservative. They also contain tannic acid (proanthocyanidins) and oxalic acids.</string>
			<string>Fresh cranberries are used for sauces, jellies and are juiced.</string>

			<string>The cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum) is a tropical tree native to Amazon rainforest. It is related to cacao – the tree from which cocoa beans are obtained. The trees can grow to heights of 20 metres, producing large and heavy oval fruits. These contain sweet and sour edible pulp and rows of nutritious seeds.</string>
			<string>Cupuaçu butter is obtained by cold-pressing. This rich butter is sometimes used to make white chocolate.</string>
			<string>Cupuaçu trees are also cultivated in many areas of Brazil and Cuba. The Cupuaçu is a traditional, rainforest food source. Its pulp and butter are increasingly important exports for the region.</string>
			<string>Our Cupuaçu fruits are wild harvested, once ripe they drop to the ground and are collected by local co-operatives from the banks of the Amazon River. This adds to the local residents’ income and provides us with a great ingredient.</string>
			<string>Cupuaçu butter is a soft and nourishing emollient and easily absorbs water. It stabilizes emulsions and moisturizes skin. The butter is consists of various beneficial fatty acids (including palmitic, stearic and oleic acids), plant polyphenols and sterols.</string>
			<string>Similar in ways to cocoa butter, it is particularly useful as a vegan alternative to animal derived lanolin.</string>
			<string>Oleic acid (omega 9 monounsaturated fatty acid) possesses interesting skin-conditioning properties. It also protects and moisturizes the skin and hair. We use cupuacu butter in our The Big Tease hair gel to give condition and shine to the hair.</string>
			<string>The combination of palmitic and stearic acids is a naturally occurring plant alternative to synthesized commercially available stearic acid, which is a waxy emulsifier in cosmetics.</string>
			<string>The plant polyphenols in cupuaçu butter act as antioxidants, which help destroy the atoms, or groups of atoms commonly referred to as ‘free radicals’ that occur as a result of normal human metabolism and exposure to sunlight, pollution and cigarette smoke. Free radicals are highly reactive and can start a damaging chain reaction in our cells, the results of which have been linked with aging. </string>

			<string>Bellis Perennis, or the Common Daisy, is also known as the True Daisy, Lawn Daisy, or English Daisy. </string>
			<string>It is an herb with a long history of medicinal use.</string>
			<string>It is native to western, central and northern Europe.. In North America, it is considered a weed because of its invasive growth. The flower heads, surrounded by white or pink-tipped petals open at dawn; they close at dusk and in dull weather, giving rise to the name ‘day’s eye.’</string>
			<string>The ‘Generall Historie of Plantes,’ 1597, recommends a mixture of unsalted butter and daisy flowers as a remedy for joint pain.</string>
			<string>Through the ages, herbalists have used it to treat ailments such as wounds, rheumatism, bronchitis and kidney problems.</string>
			<string>Steeped in folklore, the daisy has been used in many spells and has come to represent springtime, childhood and innocence. In old superstitions, a daisy chain around the neck was supposed to protect a child from being stolen by faeries.</string>
			<string>You can eat the fresh flower heads in salads, but Daisy is more commonly used in herbal decoctions and ointments. It is known to soothe skin.</string>
			<string>Mabinogion, the book of stories based on Welsh mythology and folk tales, mentions a bathing ritual using wild flowers. This inspired us to add daisy flowers to our Ceridwen’s Cauldron luxury bath melt for our very own LUSH bathing ritual. </string>
			<string>According to Mabinogion, the water should have elder leaves, or cowslip flowers, and a few, sweet scabious flowers mixed in. Unfortunately, scabious flowers proved impossible to source, so we thought daisy flowers would be the next best thing! </string>

			<string>Ripe sour cherries are harvested by vigorously shaking the trees.</string>
			<string>The cherries can be eaten raw, juiced, dried, frozen or tinned, cooked for use in pies, and jams and are also used for wine and liqueurs.</string>
			<string>The cherry stone yields edible oil that, once refined, can be used in a salad dressing. The leaves can be used as a tea. A gum can be obtained from the trunk.</string>
			<string>Traditionally, herbalists infused cherry fruit stalks to make a diuretic, astringent tonic for cystitis, oedema and diarrhoea.</string>
			<string>Cherries are used medicinally for laxative and stimulant qualities and as a well-known remedy for rheumatism, gout and arthritis.</string>
			<string>Studies suggest that sour cherries contain high levels of anthracyclines, and are anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.</string>

			<string>EDTA is a chelating agent formed of four carboxylic acid groups attached to two nitrogen atoms. In certain conditions the compound develops negative charges on four of the oxygen atoms; this allows EDTA to sequester (grab onto) free metal ions or minerals. The analogy that we like best is to describe EDTA like a lobster, with claws closing around minerals as they float past in the water!</string>
			<string>EDTA is widely used in color cosmetics, soaps, shampoos and toiletries to prevent changes in color, texture and fragrance.</string>
			<string>EDTA has several industrial, medical and dental applications and can also be used in food preservation.</string>
			<string>We use EDTA as part of our new palm-free soap base.</string>
			<string>Removing free metal ions or minerals has several benefits. Firstly it adds to the stability of the material by acting as an antioxidant, this means that soaps like Ice Blue and Miranda stay brightly colored and smelling beautiful.</string>
			<string>A further benefit of removing the metal ion is that the hardness of water is reduced, giving a better skin feel.</string>
			<string>The final benefit of removing metal ions or minerals is that it helps reduce the scum that some soaps naturally develop when used in the bath. There’s no scum on our 13 Soap (Unlucky for Dirt).</string>
			<string>Over the years, there has been much discussion about the use of EDTA. While it is agreed that it is a safe material for use in cosmetics, there are some concerns about the usage levels and how this may affect the environment. Unfortunately, when we removed EDTA from our soap there was a noticeable deterioration in the color and fragrance properties, so we decided to keep it in the formula.</string>
			<string>When thinking about this, we considered that the percentage in the soaps is incredibly small and housed in our pioneering palm-free base; we think this is our best soap base and has some of the greenest environmental credentials on the market. We use EDTA in Honey I Washed The Kids and all of our soaps and shower smoothies.</string>

			<string>Sambucus nigra is a variety of the Elder tree native to UK, Europe, North Africa and Western Asia and has naturalized in many forested and temperate parts of the world.</string>
			<string>They are popular ornamental shrubs, valued for their flowers and berries, both of which are popular in drinks, food and traditional medicines.</string>
			<string>Elder has been called ‘people&apos;s medicine chest’ by many of the nations using its fruit, flowers and various ointments made from them.</string>
			<string>It is best to collect the flowers when the clusters are wide open, fresh and full of pollen.</string>
			<string>Infusions and soothing waters made from Elderflowers have been used to soften skin, treat acne, blemishes, rashes and protect from the effects of sun burn. There are old recipes, which use Elderflower water to “fade freckles and wrinkles.”</string>
			<string>The herb is astringent and contains a substance called Eldrin, a Bioflavonoid also known as Rutin or vitamin P.</string>
			<string>Vitamin P is important for proper functioning of our blood vessels and helps to soothe weak capillaries and prevent bleeding. This vitamin is known to support our natural immune system, act as a natural anti-inflammatory agent, aid in wound healing and in the absorption of vitamin C.</string>

			<string>Evening primrose oil is obtained from the seeds of the evening primrose plant (Oenothera biennis), also known as king&apos;s-cure-all, night willow and tree primrose. The plant is part of the North American family Onagraceae. The genus is actually related to willow herbs and not to primroses (Primula).</string>
			<string>The Oenothera species is thought to have originated in Mexico and Central America, approximately 70,000 years ago, spread across the North American continent from there, and imported to Europe by Italians later. It now grows all over the world, in temperate climates.</string>
			<string>Evening primrose tolerates poor soil quality well and is a popular cultivated plant. It also grows wild along riverbanks and in sandy places.</string>
			<string>The stem and leaves are covered in tiny hairs and appear silver for this reason. The flowers are lemon yellow and fragrant, closed during the day and fully open in the evening. Unfortunately, they are short lived and last only for a day or two; an oblong and hairy pod, containing the precious seeds, then replaces the flower head.</string>
			<string>Evening primrose seeds are simply cold-pressed to obtain their oil.</string>
			<string>The roots of evening primrose were used as an appetizer to provoke a taste for wine, just as we might eat olives today.</string>
			<string>Dietary supplements made from it have been used to treat skin problems, menopausal syndromes, anxiety, brittle nails, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions. Infusions made from the whole plant were part of traditional, herbal medicine and were believed to have sedative and pain-killing properties.</string>
			<string>When applied to dry, itchy skin, organic evening primrose oil is very effective. It has been shown to help eczema, psoriasis and acne. Many of the soothing properties are attributed to gamma-linoleic acid, or GLA, a key component of the plant. The mature seeds contain approximately 7-10% of GLA. </string>
			<string>Organic evening primrose oil also contains linoleic acid (an essential fatty acid); this helps to retain the skin’s moisture content.</string>

			<string>A member of the parsley (Umbelliferae) family, fennel is prized for its mild liquorice-like flavor. There are three types of edible Fennel: one is an herb and the others are vegetables. Originally from southern Europe, it is now naturalized around the world.</string>
			<string>Fennel oil (Foeniculum vulgare) is extracted from the dried fennel seeds by steam distillation. The ripe seeds are harvested before they fall by cutting and collecting the seed heads.</string>
			<string>Common fennel is grown for its seeds and leaves, Sicilian for its tender young stems, and Florence fennel is cultivated for its very thick basal leaf stalks. The plant resembles a plump celery plant with finer leaves. Its three swollen bases form a false bulb.</string>
			<string>This oil is colorless or pale yellow and smells very sweet, but slightly earthy or peppery-spicy, with a hint of a fruity-fresh top note.</string>
			<string>Herbalists and homeopaths use fennel for treating Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and tummy pains, especially if associated with anxiousness.</string>
			<string>The dried herb, when infused with water, is commonly used as an after dinner tea to ease digestion and to help to dispel trapped gas.</string>
			<string>Diet specialists recommend drinking fennel tea for its diuretic action.</string>
			<string>Traditional gripe water was made from mixing sodium bicarbonate and fennel together to form syrup for the flatulence of infants.</string>
			<string>It even has a traditional history of protecting us from the spirit world. Parts of the fennel plant were hung outside the house to prevent witchcraft and to warn off evil spirits.</string>

			<string>Though they are widely considered to be vegetables, avocados are the fruit of a subtropical tree (belonging to the Lauraceae family) that grows in Mexico and South America. There are perhaps 500 varieties, which produce fruits ranging in size from egg-shaped to heavy pears.</string>
			<string>The Aztecs believed they had aphrodisiac qualities because of their shape. The name avocado is derived from the Mexican name ahuacatl, which is a shortening of the Aztec name ahuacacuahatl.</string>
			<string>Organic avocados are grown without pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.</string>
			<string>In the United States, avocado oil is patented as a treatment for some forms of dermatitis and arthritis. It is said that long-term treatment helps to relieve eczema. The oil is rich in vitamins A, B, C and E, all of which help to maintain healthy skin.</string>
			<string>The fruit is full of unsaturated oil that rehydrates skin. It soothes the upper layers of skin and it is good for dry, aging and peeling skin.</string>
			<string>Avocado oil is reputed to be beneficial in reducing age spots and the appearance of scars, treating wrinkles and fine lines, and in protecting against the effects of ultraviolet rays.</string>
			<string>Unruly or dry hair will benefit from avocado, too. We use fresh, organic avocados in our Jungle solid conditioner and H’Suan Wen Hua hair moisturizing treatment to nourish and soften the hair, leaving it strengthened and conditioned.</string>
			<string>Our Avobath Bath Bomb contains fresh, organic avocados for their moisturizing properties, meaning that your entire body will be softened, while the uplifting and stimulating essential oils charge your mind.</string>
			<string>We use organic avocado in our King of Skin body butter, drenching the skin with unsaturated oil to improve its appearance.</string>

			<string>The banana plant (Musa paradisiaca) is a huge, perennial herb. Its trunk consists of tightly-wrapped leaf sheaths. Its true stem pushes up from the centre and grows flower spikes or buds. Blossoms grow into upturned ‘fingers’ and there can be as many as twenty in each bunch. Some plants have been in production for a hundred years.</string>
			<string>Its fruit was used even before the cultivation of rice.</string>
			<string>It is thought to come from East Asia and Oceania.</string>
			<string>Bananas are packed with potassium and are a powerhouse of nutrition, containing many vitamins and minerals. They consist of 12% starch and lots of fibre, giving them the mucilaginous texture that we love.</string>
			<string>Fully ripened bananas have anti-fungal and antibiotic principles in both the peel and the pulp.</string>
			<string>They are emollient and highly moisturizing, when applied topically. They soften the skin, making it flexible and pliable.</string>
			<string>We use fresh, organic bananas in our H’Suan Wen Hua hair treatment to give the product a thicker texture, while also softening the hair and giving greater control.</string>
			<string>In our Oatifix Fresh Face Mask, the bananas and the oats add a unique texture. The bananas also act as an emollient and moisturizer, softening the skin as the oats soothe and protect.</string>

			<string>Eggs are one of the most nutritious foods available. They contain most of the known vitamins, apart from vitamin C, and they are also rich in minerals, such as selenium and zinc. They are a particularly good source of B-vitamins, particularly B2 (riboflavin) and B12 and vitamins D and A.</string>
			<string>Eggs are known for their high protein content. The protein in eggs contains all the essential amino acids that the human body requires.</string>
			<string>Approximately 12.5% of the weight of an egg is protein and74% of it is water.</string>
			<string>Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are thought descended from the wild red and grey jungle fowl of India (Gallus gallus and Gallus sonneratii). They have been domesticated for approximately 4,000 years and commercial egg production became popular from the 1800s onwards.</string>
			<string>Our free-range eggs come from small flocks kept on family run farms, where the welfare standards and conditions exceed those required.</string>
			<string>We use free-range eggs in both our H’suan Wen Hua hair treatment and Curly Wurly shampoo. The eggs form a protective and conditioning coating on the hair. The protein content of the eggs adds lustrous shine to the hair and helps increase its tensile strength. The vitamin D content can help to promote new hair growth.</string>
			<string>Eggs have been used as a hair-strengthening folk remedy for centuries. Egg shampoos became very fashionable, though many of them didn’t actually contain any egg!</string>
			<string>In our Cosmetic Warrior and Brazened Honey Fresh Face Masks, the vitamin A in the free-range eggs will help to maintain healthy skin by regulating natural sebum production.</string>

			<string>Garlic (Allium sativum) belongs to the lily family.</string>
			<string>It produces a thick bulb of cloves encased in a papery, white skin. It is thought to be Siberian in origin, spreading to the Middle East and Europe.</string>
			<string>As one of the world’s oldest medicines, it is mentioned in all the writings of the great ancient civilizations - Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome.</string>
			<string>It has long been considered an aphrodisiac; for this reason, nuns, yogis and monks all eliminate garlic from their diets.</string>
			<string>It is rich in both sulphur and iodine. Allicin is the compound responsible for garlic’s strong aroma and is strongest when the bulbs are freshly crushed or cut. This is destroyed when cooked.</string>
			<string>Garlic is thought to be both antibiotic and a potent fungicide, and biochemical research has isolated allicin as the active component. A single raw, crushed clove contains the antibiotic equivalent of 100,000 units of penicillin. Allicin has proved more effective than either penicillin or tetracycline in suppressing certain disease carrying agents.</string>
			<string>Garlic is an extremely popular culinary flavoring.</string>
			<string>Garlic’s antiseptic effect is powerful, but very mild and ideal for acne-troubled skin.</string>
			<string>Garlic’s active allicin content is a powerful ingredient in our Cosmetic Warrior Fresh Face Mask. Its deep-cleansing action helps to reduce spots and clear the complexion, leaving the skin soft, fresh and comfortable.</string>

			<string>Grapefruit was first described in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century as ‘the forbidden fruit.’ It is a hybrid between an orange and a pomelo. It belongs to the Rutaceae plant family. It is a large evergreen fruit tree that originates from Jamaica. It can grow up to 9m tall and can produce around 500 fruits per year. Most of the world’s grapefruits are produced in USA, particularly in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona. They are also cultivated in Tropical Asia and West Indies.</string>
			<string>A popular breakfast food, grapefruits aid digestion and are a good source of vitamin C. They contain phytochemicals that can interfere with the absorption of medicines.</string>
			<string>Grapefruit juice is acidic and antibacterial; a topical application of it is particularly suitable for oily, spot-prone skin.</string>

			<string>It is widely thought that the grape was established throughout the world long before the arrival of humans. Grape (Vitis vinifera), our most common grape, is one of the oldest cultivated plants, some of the earliest records of which exist in Egypt, dated around 4000 BC.</string>
			<string>Grape is the generic name given to the berry of a grape vine plant. There are several species that make up the genus Vitis (family Vitaceae), including varieties that are eaten as fruit, dried to produce raisins, currants and sultanas, or crushed to make juice and wine.</string>
			<string>One of the most praised health foods, grapes are a good source of vitamins and minerals, containing magnesium, potassium, vitamins A, C and several of the vitamin B group.</string>
			<string>‘The queen of fruits,’ as grape is sometimes known, has a wide variety of uses due to its excellent properties as a medicinal plant. When eaten, they are anti-viral and are recommended for those recovering from illness. They help treat constipation and have antioxidant properties.</string>
			<string>Grapes are a natural source of malic acid, an important alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) ingredient in cosmetics. Malic acid is a colourless, crystalline compound used as flavouring in foods, such as sour confectionery and in the ageing of wine.</string>
			<string>AHAs have become important ingredients in cosmetics. Ancient uses go back as far as Cleopatra bathing in asses’ milk, which would have been rich in lactic acid.</string>

			<string>Iris florentina is a large genus of about 300 species found in Northern temperate regions. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean. It bears grey-white flowers with yellow inner beards and its underground rhizomes are the source of valued orris powder and absolute.</string>
			<string>Orris absolute (the oldest and most expensive perfumery material) is steam distilled from the dried and powdered rhizomes, which have to be stored for several years to develop their violet-like fragrance. Iris flowers are sometimes used to flavour gin.</string>
			<string>Iris flowers are the origin of the sceptre and the fleur-de-lys; the three inner petals represent faith, wisdom, and valour.</string>
			<string>We make our fresh iris extract by extracting the whole, fresh flower heads in water.</string>

			<string>The kiwi plant (Actinidia chinensis – the Chinese gooseberry) is native to the Yangtze valley in Northern China and the Zhejiang province in Eastern China. It is a vigorous climbing plant. It has a centre starburst and a cluster of black seeds. A hairy skin covers the green flesh of the kiwi fruit.</string>
			<string>In China, the fruit was unpopular and was only eaten for medicinal purposes as a tonic to the health. An eminent plant explorer, E. H. Wilson, shipped the first seeds from Asia to England, France and the U.S. in the early 1900s, where they were grown as ornamental vines.</string>
			<string>The first seed lot was planted in 1906 and the ornamental vine was bred from then on for its crop of nutritious fruit, rather than for its decorative appearance. However, their commercial potential was not truly recognized until the 1960s in New Zealand. The name was given in the 1960s in recognition of the national bird of New Zealand, the kiwi. The fruits are egg-shaped, fuzzy and brown.</string>
			<string>Kiwi fruits are full of vitamins and minerals, making them highly nutritious. They contain a very high level of vitamin C, exceeding that of oranges, as well as excellent levels of vitamins E and A. Their mineral content is exceptional, too. The high concentration of potassium may help wound healing.</string>
			<string>Raw kiwi fruits contain an enzyme called actinidin and this acts to dissolve protein. Enzymes are an organic chemical substance made by living cells. They accelerate a chemical reaction without being used up in the process and are known as catalysts. Each enzyme is only capable of promoting one type of chemical reaction. All living cells contain a large number of different enzymes and are dependent on their activity for their normal functions. Enzymes are vital in all cellular processes and, for example, break down large molecules into smaller ones. They are indispensable to life.</string>
			<string>The action of actinidin will break down protein-based, dead skin cells and dirt on the skin. This can then be removed, leaving the skin fresh and clean. The other vitamins and minerals in the fruit are highly nutritious for the skin. This cleansing and nourishing process is achieved by using the fruit fresh, mulched straight in to the product. The vitamin content greatly improves skin condition. We have used nutritious fresh kiwi fruit in our Vanilla Dee-Lite hand and body lotion to deeply nourish and produce a glowing fresh skin. </string>
			<string>In our Ayesha Fresh Face Mask, kiwi fruit refreshes and cleanses the skin.</string>

			<string>The juice is highly antioxidant, naturally antibacterial and rich in enzymes. The enzymes remove dirt and debris, which means it adds volume and shine to hair and increases tensile strength. </string>
			<string>In skin care, it clarifies and improves tone.</string>

			<string>Mint (Mentha) is named after the Greek nymph ‘Minthe,’ which means ‘green’. There are many varieties of mint of the Labiatae plant family, but our fresh mint is Mentha piperita or peppermint.</string>
			<string>Mints are native to the Near East, these herbs are now grown all over the world.</string>
			<string>Mint was used in ancient times for many different purposes and is still used today in teas, iced drinks, and salads.</string>
			<string>Herbalists use it externally to treat itching skin conditions, burns, ringworm, and respiratory tract infections.</string>
			<string>It is well known for its strong and cooling flavour and smell; this is mainly due to the menthol present in the plant. Menthol is antiseptic and cooling.</string>
			<string>The fresh mint leaves share properties with the peppermint essential oil that we use in our perfume.</string>
			<string>The leaves are broken stripped from the stalks and blended straight into our products.</string>

			<string>Orange juice is a popular ingredient in homemade face masks and cosmetics - and topical application of it may help keep the skin clear due to the acidity of the juice. Oranges contain minerals, vitamins, and plenty of vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant. Antioxidants in cosmetics can help combat the activity of free radicals and protect against the effects of sun damage.</string>
			<string>Historically, the colour of oranges was coveted by many and favoured by royalty. Oranges are also thought to have been the “golden apples” grown in the garden on Hesperides in Greek mythology.</string>
			<string>Oranges and orange blossoms are highly symbolic in many cultures. Brides have traditionally worn orange blossom to symbolize fertility. Chinese New year celebrations feature oranges for good luck and prosperity.</string>
			<string>Arab traders brought bitter oranges to Europe, but in the 15th century, the Portuguese introduced the sweet orange and it quickly became very popular due to its more palatable taste. Columbus introduced the orange into the Western Hemisphere along with other citrus fruits and two hundred years later the Franciscan Fathers took citrus seeds from Mexico to California. Today, the major producers of sweet orange are Brazil, United States, Spain and Italy.</string>
			<string>We buy in organic oranges throughout the year, mainly from Italy and topped up from Spain and South Africa when necessary. We squeeze our own fresh juice at the factory, which is then used in our fresh handmade recipes.</string>
			<string>Fresh orange juice is a source of natural fruit acid (citric acid). Pectin (which is used as a gelling agent in food and cosmetics and has important uses in medicine) is isolated from the inner peel. The peel and white pith inside contain an important flavonoid called hesperedin, which is under investigation by scientists because it has shown antioxidant and anti fungal properties.</string>

			<string>Native to the Americas, the pineapple (Ananas sativus) was known to the indigenous people, and is thought to have been spread by the Indians to the West Indies before the arrival of explorers and colonists.</string>
			<string>Resembling a yucca, the plant produces succulent, spiky leaves, closely spaced in a rosette on a thick and fleshy stem. The clusters of light purple flowers become fleshy and fuse together to form the pineapple fruit.</string>
			<string>Along with vitamins and fruit acids, pineapples contain bromelain, making it an effective medicinal plant. Bromelain extracted from pineapple is one of the most popular health food supplements in Europe. It was first isolated in the 1800s.</string>
			<string>The medicinal uses of pineapple date back to its varied, native traditions. Its fermented juice was made into an alcoholic drink to relieve fevers. Externally, the juice was used for skin ailments and softening callouses.</string>
			<string>Many athletes eat it fresh, believing its anti-inflammatory properties will help heal sports injuries and the enzymes in it will enhance fat metabolism and aid digestion.</string>
			<string>Pineapple juice, with its malic and citric acids, will literally ‘consume’ dead skin cells and dirt from the surface of the skin, stimulating and brightening it. These acids are alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs.</string>
			<string>The alpha hydroxy acids and bromelain content will bring soothing and clarifying effects when used on the skin. This combination of enzymic activity and effective AHA action is particularly good for tired and dull skin.</string>
			<string>Using fresh fruit enzymes on the skin is an excellent way to encourage it to remain at its best. Bromelain has a gentle but powerful ability to stimulate and brighten the complexion. Using bromelain ensures the action is balanced and effective. The citric and malic acids in pineapple are similarly controlled, as they are part of the content of a whole fresh fruit.</string>
			<string>We have used fresh pineapple juice in our Rehab shampoo to actively clear and cleanse the hair and scalp.</string>
			<string>We use fresh pineapple juice in our Gorgeous skin cream. Its fruit acids and AHAs will help to cleanse thoroughly and revive tired skin.</string>

Grapefruit was first described in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as ‘the forbidden fruit.’ It is a hybrid between an orange and a pomelo.</string>
			<string>Grapefruit belongs to the Rutaceae plant family. It is a large evergreen fruit tree from Jamaica; growing up to 9m tall, the trees can produce approximately 500 fruits per year.</string>
			<string>Most of the world’s grapefruits are produced in USA, particularly in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona.</string>
			<string>A popular breakfast food, grapefruits aid digestion and are a good source of vitamin C. They contain phytochemicals that can interfere with the absorption of medicines.</string>

			<string>The mature portobello mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is a flat, low-lying, brown fungus. It can grow to approximately 12cm, but this can vary depending on conditions. It is commonly used for culinary purposes for its thick, meaty texture.</string>
			<string>Mushrooms are the fleshy bodies of fungi. They have no leaves or seeds and reproduce by sowing spores, which develop thread-like roots called mycelia. Technically, the mycelium forms the main organism and the visible mushroom is its fruit. Mushrooms are extremely fertile, with each mushroom producing trillions of spores in its lifetime. Since they have no leaves, they rely on the nutrients in the ground for nourishment.</string>
			<string>In ancient times, mushrooms had a reputation for magic and the supernatural. It was thought that they were brought into existence by bolts of lightning. Some cultures viewed them as food for the gods, and even went as far as forbidding the middle and lower classes from eating them. In Ancient Egypt, only the pharaohs were allowed to consume them.</string>
			<string>Portobellos are popular mushrooms for cooking. Much like bamboo shoots, they absorb the flavours of sauces they are cooked in.</string>
			<string>The word mushroom is thought to derive from the Old French ‘mousseron.’</string>
			<string>Portobello mushrooms have more potassium than a banana. They do not contain any sugar, making them a suitable foodstuff for diabetics. Studies suggest that mushrooms are a source of vitamin D, particularly when exposed to ultraviolet light.</string>
			<string>They are rich in ergothioneine, a potent antioxidant compound, which can help to repair damage from oxidisation. This action is useful in cosmetic products because it can greatly benefit the skin.</string>
			<string>We blend fresh portobello mushrooms and add them to our fresh, handmade cosmetics.</string>
			<string>We use fresh portobello mushrooms in our Full of Grace serum bar for their skin-conditioning properties. The mushrooms are packed with beneficial antioxidant B and C vitamins.</string>

			<string>Today’s vast array of rose varieties was achieved by crossing approximately 10 original species.</string>
			<string>Roses have been important from the earliest of times in rituals, cosmetics, perfumes, soaps, food flavouring and medicines. In A.D.77, Pliny recorded 32 different ailments that could benefit from the use of the rose. The British Pharmacopoeia listed the petals as astringent.</string>
			<string>Rose is said to have been the first floral essential oil to be distilled and has been important in fragrances and flavors for thousands of years. Rose oil has been highly valued throughout history.</string>

			<string>Though water is important in cosmetics, we are experts at making products that do not contain water, such as our solid shampoos and bubble bars. Our Fresh Face Masks control water content, establishing microbiological quality.</string>

			<string>The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is a member of the potato family and the nightshade genus, and it originates from western South America. There are now thousands of varieties, adapted to all sorts of climates across the globe.</string>
			<string>It is technically a fruit, as the red tomato can be classified as a berry, but the US Supreme Court labelled it as a vegetable after a dispute on import duties.</string>
			<string>Ripe tomatoes contain many ingredients beneficial to the skin, vitamins A and C, potassium and lycopene; however, 93% of this fruit is water.</string>
			<string>Vitamin C is vital for our health, aiding the production of collagen (a protein that helps to hold cells together and is needed for wound healing). It is also essential for healthy blood vessels, gums, teeth and bones. It boosts our immune system, acts as an antioxidant, contributes to brain function and assists in the absorption of iron and calcium from the diet. </string>
			<string>Taken internally, potassium is important for many body processes, including proper functioning of nerves and muscles.</string>
			<string>Lycopene is a carotenoid, an antioxidant that combats the activity of free radicals and protects against sun damage; this also colors tomatoes red.</string>
			<string>Tomato cools and refreshes the skin, and is such a good deodorant that it is able to neutralize the defence spray of skunks.</string>

			<string>Wheat is one of the oldest cultivated plants and its history can be traced back 10,000 years. It is thought that early Middle Eastern, Egyptian and Chinese civilizations domesticated it from wild grasses found in Central Asia.</string>
			<string>Wheat crops became very important to the Romans, and as their empire grew, so did the spread of wheat as a food staple.</string>
			<string>During the Dark Ages, wheat all but disappeared from the European menu, as only the rich could afford it. It only became affordable to all around the 19th century.</string>
			<string>European colonists heading for America brought wheat and other grain with them in the 15th and 16th centuries and today wheat is grown in almost every country.</string>
			<string>Wheatgrass is wheat sprouted to the point where it resembles grass. It is chiefly made up of chlorophyll and contains vitamins, minerals, enzymes and protein.</string>
			<string>Wheatgrass is a popular as a health food supplement in fresh, juiced and tablet form. Many believe that wheat grass helps to purify the blood and aid the liver in digesting toxins.</string>
			<string>In skincare, wheatgrass is antioxidant and skin-conditioning.</string>
			<string>To make our decoction, we boil fresh wheatgrass in water for up to ten minutes, then strain the mix and add it to our fresh, handmade cosmetics.</string>
			<string>For its ability to condition the skin, we use fresh wheatgrass decoction in our Skin’s Shangri-La moisturizer. Combined with the other fresh ingredients, we’ve created a luxurious and nourishing cream to care for your skin.</string>
			<string>We liquidize our fresh wheatgrass and blend it straight into our products.</string>
			<string>We use fresh wheatgrass in The Sacred Truth Fresh Face Mask for its antioxidant and moisturizing qualities. The beneficial minerals, vitamins and enzymes are applied directly to the face, treating you to some of nature’s finest materials.</string>

			<string>The common gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides, Cape jasmine) is known for its beautiful white flowers and exotic scent. An evergreen shrub, it is thought to have originated in China and Japan, but can also be found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Australasia. </string>
			<string>Gardenia yields a deep orange to yellow viscous liquid, containing a strong pigment (principally, the carotenoid crocin). This can be used to color many of our products. When blended with other ingredients, this can offer a lovely pallet of varying hues.</string>
			<string>When included in our best selling Olive Branch shower gel, the colour blends with the olive oil and creates a Mediterranean sunset effect.</string>
			<string>The gardenia is popular as a garden plant, but it is also useful to the perfumer and aromatherapist.</string>

			<string>Aromatherapists have used it widely for its antiseptic and astringent qualities and which is useful in skin products.

			<string>Ginseng is shrouded in mystery and superstition. It is the most important plant in Ancient Chinese medicine, and it has been in use there as a tonic for at least 5,000 years. Ginseng is used as a culinary herb in Asia; it has a sour taste with a sweet undertone.</string>
			<string>Ginseng is still popular today; the Chinese believe it to be anti-ageing, aphrodisiac, and a general cure-all. According to myth, the root is a representation of the spirit of God on earth.</string>
			<string>Another famous myth is that of a Chinese herbalist, Li Ching Yun, who is claimed to have lived to the ripe age of 256 years. He named ginseng as one of the herbs he took for longevity.</string>
			<string>Ginseng is the underground root of a trailing ground cover plant. Several varieties exist, but we use the Asian variety. It is predominantly grown in China, Korea and the United States.</string>
			<string>The English name ginseng derives from the Chinese &lt;em&gt;jen shen&lt;/em&gt;, meaning ‘essence of earth, shaped like a man.’</string>
			<string>The roots are lifted and used fresh or dried in decoctions, liquid extracts, pills, and powders.</string>
			<string>Although a few scientific studies exist about the fabled healing properties of ginseng, nothing conclusive has been proven to date. Russian scientists conducted studies in the 1950s that boosted the popularity of the Siberian variety. The herb remains a favoured remedy and a food supplement.</string>

			<string>Glycerine is a clear, viscous liquid, which dissolves completely in water. It occurs widely in nature, and was traditionally obtained from animal fat or tallow as a by-product of soap making. Finding a non-tallow source of glycerine has been a challenge. The vegetable oil involved in the production of our glycerine is soy based from the USA.</string>
			<string>When a caustic, or highly alkaline, material is added to animal fats or vegetable oils (such as olive, coconut or palm) glycerine is formed along with a fatty fraction, which is actually soap.</string>
			<string>Glycerine is a traditional cosmetic material and has been used for many years because it is so safe and effective. It is also used in foods and pharmaceuticals.</string>
			<string>Glycerine is a humectant, absorbing water-based materials into its structure. In a cosmetic product, glycerine will carry effective ingredients, such as aloe gel or fruit juices, into the skin where their beneficial effects can be utilized. It is very mild and will not irritate in any way.</string>
			<string>Our glycerine is now palm-free.</string>
			<string>We use glycerine in our Bohemian soap, for its moisturizing properties soften the skin, while also allowing the absorption of the toning lemon oil. It also balances the cleansing effects of the soap.</string>
			<string>We use glycerine in our beautiful skin creams, Gorgeous, Imperialis, Enchanted and Celestial; it mixes with other luxurious ingredients, such as lavender, almond oil, oat milk, calamine or rosemary, to create a wonderful treatment for the skin.</string>
			<string>In our Fresh Face Masks, glycerine softens the skin and carries into it the nourishing elements from the fresh ingredients. In Cupcake, glycerine helps the skin to absorb the rich cocoa butter, fresh mint, sandalwood oil and vanilla absolute; in Cosmetic Warrior, the fresh, green grapes, free range eggs, honey and tea tree oil. Its presence reduces the water content of the product, eliminating the need for synthetic preservatives by creating a short shelf life.</string>
			<string>Our innovative shower jellies are a combination of surfactants and glycerine. These products are carefully balanced to leave the skin clean and moisturized. As much as 30% of glycerine is used, helping to prevent the jelly from freezing when stored in the fridge or freezer.</string>

			<string>Glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate is a combination of two emulsifying (and emulsion stabilizing) ingredients. Glyceryl stearate is a solid and waxy compound. It is made by reacting glycerine (a soap by-product) with stearic acid (a naturally occurring, vegetable fatty acid). PEG-100 stearate is an off-white, solid ester of polyethylene glycol (a binder and a softener) and stearic acid.</string>
			<string>The surfactant qualities of glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate allow oil and water to mix. The stabilizing effect of these two ingredients means that the product remains blended and will not separate.</string>
			<string>Creams and lotions are water and oil droplets held together by materials called emulsifiers, without them oil droplets would float on top of the water. When formulating our creams and lotions, we carefully consider the levels of fatty acids in other materials (such as cocoa and shea butters).</string>
			<string>When used in a moisturizer, this forms a protective barrier on the surface of skin, greatly assisting moisture retention.</string>
			<string>We&apos;ve also used glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 combination in our innovative Jungle solid hair conditioner. The emulsifying qualities enable fresh ingredients to be emulsified with softening cocoa butter and soya lecithin. The result is an effective product, which detangles the hair, and leaves it in excellent condition.</string>
			<string>Solid conditioners are very environmentally friendly. To date, we have saved the use of three million bottles (equivalent to ninety tonnes of plastic) because our customers have chosen to use our solid shampoos and conditioners.</string>

			<string>The grape (Vitis vinifera) is thought to have been growing wild throughout the world long before the arrival of humans. Our most common grape is one of the oldest cultivated plants.</string>
			<string>The grape vine is a woody, climbing plant in most areas, but in arid regions, it can form an erect shrub. The grapes grow in clusters, ranging in color from black and blue to red and white. There are several species in the genus Vitis (family Vitaceae) and Vitis vinifera is the most commonly used in wine making.</string>
			<string>Grape cultivation (Viticulture) has undoubtedly been fuelled by humankind&apos;s fascination with stimulating drinks, and wine is certainly one of the most popular choices. Produce from grapes, including wine, was very important to the Romans as a major source of revenue. Grapes, raisins, wine and vinegar were precious trade items in the ancient Near East.</string>
			<string>Grapes are a good source of vitamins A, C and B, and they are packed with minerals, too.</string>
			<string>In cosmetics, grape juice is a desirable ingredient for its antibacterial and antioxidant properties. The juice is rich in malic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). AHAs help to restore moisture, exfoliate the skin’s top layers and aid absorption of other ingredients.</string>
			<string>Grape juice is said to reduce the appearance wrinkles when applied to the face.</string>

			<string>Grapefruit was first described in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as ‘the forbidden fruit.’ It is a hybrid between an orange and a pomelo. It belongs to the Rutaceae plant family. It is a large evergreen fruit tree that originates from Jamaica. It can grow up to 9m tall and can produce around 500 fruits per year.</string>
			<string>Most of the world’s grapefruits are produced in USA, particularly in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona. They are also cultivated in Tropical Asia and West Indies.</string>
			<string>A popular breakfast food, grapefruits aid digestion and are a good source of vitamin C. They contain phytochemicals that can interfere with the absorption of medicines.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists use grapefruit oil as a refreshing and tonic fragrance; it reminds us of the sun’s energy and can help perk up a dull morning. It’s popular oil for lifting the mood and has been used extensively to clear the mind and help with stress, depression and even Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) that can strike during dark winter months.</string>
			<string>The fruits are large and pale yellow and the oil is extracted, by cold expression, from the peel. The oil is pale yellow and has a sweet citrus aroma.

			<string>Camellia sinensis, the tea plant, is a small, evergreen shrub with elliptic leaves and white flowers. Different teas are obtained from its leaves, and they are also harvested for essential oil. Green tea is made from the freshly plucked leaves, which are first blasted with steam and roasted, then dried or ground to a powder.</string>
			<string>Tea contains polyphenols, which are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic.</string>
			<string>In cosmetics, green tea is used as a preservative because of its antibacterial properties. As green tea is not fermented, it retains its beneficial properties.</string>
			<string>According to legend, tea was first cultivated in China and first used during the reign of Emperor Shen Nung (around 2737BC). The tea plant made its way to Japan in about AD800, first regarded as a purely medicinal herb, and eventually becoming a popular beverage. Tea arrived in England around 1660, via the East India Company, spreading to Europe thereafter.</string>
			<string>Though China remained the bulk supplier of tea into the twentieth century, tea is produced commercially in over thirty countries, India being the chief exporter. The British Isles are the largest importers of tea and green tea is gaining in popularity with the boom of healthy drinks for dieters.</string>
			<string>Green tea is an astringent, used internally to stimulate the nervous system and for its antioxidant and antibacterial properties.</string>
			<string>The unfermented tea is lighter and more refreshing. Green tea contains polyphenols and the enzyme superoxide dismutase; both of these have powerful antioxidant properties.</string>

			<string>There are two types of almond (sweet and bitter), but we use the sweet one. The almond is a fruit and a part of the plum family. The almond tree is a medium-sized tree, native to the Middle East and North Africa. Its white blossom is captivating and beautiful, inspiring many legends.</string>
			<string>Ancient Egyptians valued the almond for cosmetic purposes.</string>
			<string>The ancient Greeks and Romans used to eat almonds to counter the effect of alcohol.</string>
			<string>The almond tree was first cultivated in Britain in the 1500s when it was grown for its blossom. The herbalist Gerard said, &apos;Almonds were in our London gardens and orchards in great plenty.&apos;</string>
			<string>Our almonds originate in the warmth of California, one of the largest almond growing areas in the world.</string>
			<string>The almonds are shelled and the shells are then ground. Almond crops are very susceptible to weather, achieving larger quantities in sunny climates. The trees themselves don&apos;t produce almonds for the first three or four years of their lives and will be productive until around twenty-five years. To produce the almonds, the flowers need to be pollinated and many of the producers keep beehives to encourage this.</string>
			<string>The finely ground shell of the sweet almond creates an effective exfoliant. In Aqua Mirabilis body butter, it creates a gentle exfoliating action whilst the other ingredients soften your skin. </string>

			<string>The word rice (Oryza sativa) stems from the Greek ‘orzia.’</string>
			<string>A staple grain of half the world, rice has developed from wild grasses found in Asia and Indochina and is now widely cultivated throughout the world in areas with warm climates and abundant water.</string>
			<string>Rice is covered in an inedible husk, which has to be removed before eating. Beneath this is another layer, the bran, which contains 10% of the protein, 85% of the fat, 70% of the minerals, and a large amount of the B vitamins. This layer is left on for whole grain (brown) rice, while for processed (white) rice it is removed; this allows the rice to cook faster. Its removal also leads to a loss of important fibre, vitamins and minerals.</string>
			<string>The rice is harvested and rubber rollers remove the husk. Our ground rice is produced by grinding the rice into a rough powder.</string>
			<string>We add ground rice to Buffy as an exfoliant; the slight roughness of the ground rice sloughs away surface dry skin cells to reveal a brighter, fresher looking skin. In a shaving product, it also raises the beard prior to shaving.</string>

			<string>Hibiscus sabdariffa is an annual herb with a woody lower stem and long narrow leaves. It is thought to be native to India, Indonesia, Malaysia and West Africa. Sabdariffa is also known as roselle, karkade, jelly okra, Java jute, Jamaican sorrel and Florida cranberry.</string>
			<string>Roselle’s flowers are pale yellow with deep red or purple colored centres. A fleshy, fruit calyx forms once the flowers have bloomed and withered. The fruit’s kidney shaped seeds are encased within the calyx.</string>
			<string>The calyxes are harvested by hand in the autumn, and the juicy outer covering is separated from the seed pods. They are left to dry, processed immediately or sold fresh; the seed pods are opened to process the seeds.</string>
			<string>All above ground parts of the roselle have been used and valued for centuries in traditional herbal medicine; the roselle has long been used in herbal medicines, particularly in Indian Ayurveda, Thai traditions, Mexico and parts of Africa.</string>
			<string>The plant contains some of the same flavonoids, polyphenols and anthocyanins as red wine. Taken internally these anti-oxidants have been shown to lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure.</string>
			<string>Hibiscus seed oil is high in linoleic and oleic fatty acids, and contains a form of vitamin E, a fat soluble antioxidant.</string>
			<string>Vitamin E has many benefits. It is considered important for cell protection, and for the healthy maintenance of our immune system and skin. It is said to be both anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Studies have shown that topical application can decrease roughness of the skin, dryness and fine lines.</string>
			<string>Oleic acid (omega-9) is also found in olive oil and is one of the most beneficial substances for our internal and external health. Linoleic (omega-6) is an essential fatty acid required for wound healing and for the formation of healthy cells.</string>
			<string>These fatty acids in hibiscus seed oil, combined with vitamin E, means that topical application will likely help to alleviate dry skin and discoloration.</string>

			<string>Honey is a fragrant, sweet, sticky liquid made by honeybees. The bees collect nectar from a variety of plants, carry it to their nests and convert it to honey. The color, fragrance and properties of honey are determined by the source of the nectar.</string>
			<string>Its beneficial effects, both on human health and as a topical treatment, were soon discovered. It is believed that honey was added to make medicines more palatable and to provide easy to digest nutrition to those with compromised immune systems or ill health.</string>
			<string>Evidence shows us that honey contains nutrients and antibacterial, antiseptic, antioxidant and anti fungal substances. Left undiluted, honey is also self-preserving and will remain edible and usable for years, although it may crystallize (a natural process, which can be remedied by the application of a little heat).</string>
			<string>Honey has been used as a skin ointment for over 2000 years, and was often used to lighten skin and hair, because it contains an enzyme that produces small amounts of hydrogen peroxide when diluted. This action is responsible for much of honey’s antibacterial effect and was called ‘inhibine’ before it was identified as hydrogen peroxide. When diluted in water, the hydrogen peroxide becomes more active and can act as a slow-release antiseptic. The other phytochemical substances in honey buffer the antibacterial action and make this a very safe way to help skin heal itself.</string>
			<string>Honey has been successfully used to treat problematic skin conditions, such as diabetic ulcers, and it is a traditional remedy for infected acne spots.</string>
			<string>Poppea, the second wife of Nero, used a mixture of milk and honey for her complexion and Cleopatra bathed in honey and asses’ milk. It is said that du Barry, an infamous mistress of Louis XV of France, used honey as a face moisturizer. Honey is a natural humectant (it attracts and retains moisture), and therefore, a wonderfully gentle moisturizer.</string>
			<string>Honey is one of the fresh ingredients in our Honey Bee Bath Bomb. When dropped into a hot bath, the honey is dispersed through the water, moisturizing the skin and creating a nourishing bath fit for a queen.</string>
			<string>The antibacterial action of honey helps to thoroughly clean the skin in our Flying Fox shower gel.</string>
			<string>The delicious Whipstick and Honey Trap lip balms contain honey. They moisturize the lips and protect them against damage. </string>

			<string>Illipe butter is an exotic butter derived from the nuts of the Shorea stenoptera, a species of the Dipterocarpaceae plant family.</string>
			<string>The majestic illipe trees can grow to 15m in height and are native to Malaysia, typically found in Borneo. A phenomenon of many Dipterocarp forests is the remarkable feature of mass flowering, followed by mass fruiting.</string>
			<string>The nuts are around 5cm long and 3cm in diameter, they are enclosed in a thin, brittle case with wing-like attachments that help the nut fall clear of the mother tree.</string>
			<string>Nuts are collected from the forest floor and dried in the sun until the shells are brittle enough to be separated; the nuts are then pressed to extract the raw fat within. The nuts contain about 50% fat.</string>
			<string>This fat has been used for centuries by the native Dayaks to treat skin problems.</string>
			<string>The butter is creamy white with a mild odor.</string>
			<string>Illipe butter resembles cocoa butter, but has a higher melting point.</string>
			<string>We have used in illipe butter in our Oatifix Fresh Face Mask for its softening quality.</string>
			<string>Illipe will moisturize the skin, restoring its flexibility, and some say this is the most nourishing of all the butters. We have used Illipe butter in our Vanilla Dee-Lite body lotion for its rich moisturizing quality.</string>

			<string>Indigo herb (Indigofera tinctoria) is known as Neel and Wasma. Indigofera is Latin for ‘indigo bearing.’ The Indigofera genus describes 700 species of trees, shrubs and annual and perennial herbs, belonging to the pea family.</string>
			<string>It is a deciduous shrub, growing between one and two metres high. Its leaves are small and green; its flowers are red to purple in color. It grows in subtropical regions and temperate areas of India and thrives on sunlight.</string>
			<string>Grown from seed, indigo is harvested bi-annually. Its mature plants are cut off above the soil and dried in the open for up to four days. The leaves are collected, crushed and stored. The crushed leaves are pulverized into a powder to order.</string>
			<string>Indigo is an ancient dye plant known for the clarity and fastness of the blue color. This dye is used to color denim and in natural hair colors.</string>
			<string>The modern synthesis of indigo is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, N-phenylglycine is treated with an alkaline melt of sodium and potassium hydroxides containing sodamide. This produces indoxyl, which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo.</string>
			<string>Our indigo powder is a natural dye from Indigofera tinctoria leaves, and it is not to be confused with indigotine (E 132), which is manufactured chemically and used to dye fabrics.</string>
			<string>To deepen the intensity of our Caca henna hair colors, we use Indigo powder; this oxidizes when exposed to air and water, so the Indigo is activated when mixed with hot water.</string>
			<string>With our darker cacas, we recommend that, once they are applied, you leave the hair exposed to both air and steam (run a bath and sit in the bathroom!) to allow the color to develop. Tease the hair out occasionally to allow the air to reach different parts of the hair. For the best result, leave the caca on the hair for at least 30 minutes to an hour.</string>

			<string>The decoction is a thick jelly. It is both soothing and softening for the skin and the scalp.</string>
			<string>In our Hair Doctor hair moisturizing treatment, Irish moss is used both as a decoction and as a powder. In both forms, it conditions the hair, softens the scalp and makes hair glossy and vibrant.</string>
			<string>Irish moss gel is a fine jelly, which soothes and softens the skin and hair. We use it in face masks, shower soaps, shampoo bars, bath products, and cleansers.</string>

			<string>Jasmine belongs to the large olive family (Oleaceae), which consists of woody shrubs and climbers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World, but has been widely cultivated elsewhere. Jasmines can be grown in cold climates, but usually require frost protection or greenhouse cultivation to flourish. We buy our jasmine absolute from Egypt and India.</string>
			<string>The star-shaped flowers are white to pale yellow and extremely fragrant. They open to release their scent at night. Several unrelated plants are also referred to as &apos;jasmines&apos;.</string>
			<string>Indian Ayurvedic medicine and Chinese traditional medicine feature the use of jasmine blossoms and oil. In India, the oil was considered luxurious and an indication of wealth; and the flowers are widely grown in home gardens as well as for commercial production. Jasmine flowers are also important in Hindu ceremonies and are mentioned in religious texts.</string>
			<string>Both men and women have long used jasmine oil in India as an aphrodisiac, hair and beauty tonic and as a sensual perfume.</string>
			<string>Jasmine was brought to Europe in the 16th century and became a staple ingredient in the growing perfume industry. In Grasse, France, every August jasmine festival is held there. Revellers scatter jasmine water and flowers over celebrating crowds, and the town comes alive with music, events and visitors from all over the world.</string>
			<string>The jasmine flowers are processed through solvent extraction to produce a concrete, from which the absolute is made. It can take thousands of jasmine flowers just to produce 1 kilo of absolute, a thick, dark-orange liquid, which has an intensely floral, rich aroma.</string>
			<string>Jasmine is often used in cosmetics for its fragrance, but it is also valued in aromatherapy for sensitive skins, muscular complaints, depression and other stress-related conditions.</string>
			<string>Jasmine is one of our favorite materials and we use jasmine absolute in many of our best-selling products, including Sex Bomb and Vanilla Fountain Bath Bomb. Jasmine and Henna Fluff-eaze will scent your hair with it for days!</string>
			<string>It is part of the rich, sensual aroma of our Flying Fox shower gel.</string>
			<string>To make our jasmine flower infusion, we wrap the petals of Jasminum officinale in muslin and infuse them in boiled water.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists recommend jasmine for relieving stress and pre-menstrual tensions. It is said to relax mind and body, also acting as an aphrodisiac.</string>
			<string>Jasmine flower infusion is a water-based ingredient, ideal for hair and skin. In Rub, Rub, Rub shower gel, its floral aroma stimulates your senses and soothes the skin.</string>

			<string>Organic jojoba oil (phonetically: ho-ho-ba) is a unique liquid wax obtained from the seeds of the jojoba shrub (Simmondsia chinensis).</string>
			<string>The plant is native to the Sonoran Desert (Northwest Mexico and Southwest USA). Jojoba shrubs can take up to 3 years to reach flowering maturity from seed. The shrub&apos;s deep root system and leathery leaves make it well suited to droughts and intense heat, even deserts. Jojoba is cultivated for its commercially important oil crop, but it is also grown in difficult areas to prevent soil erosion. Jojoba oil is commercially cultivated in Mexico, Israel, Argentina and in USA.</string>
			<string>Jojoba oil is an excellent moisturizer and a softener for skin and scalp, which makes it an ideal ingredient to soften the beard and give emolliency to the skin whilst shaving with our Razourantium and Ambrosia shaving creams.</string>
			<string>Due to jojoba oils affinity with our own sebum, it is more readily absorbed and tolerated by the top layer of our skin. We use organic jojoba oil in our King of Skin body butter, and luxury bath melt Dreamtime, because it is so easily absorbed into the skin.</string>
			<string>In cases where excess sebum is present, jojoba oil can help to dissolve and clean it away. We use organic jojoba oil in our Rehab shampoo, and Godiva shampoo bars to deeply cleanse the hair and scalp.</string>
			<string>Jojoba oil is very well suited to conditioning and coating the hair shaft; adding shine and manageability. The Hair Doctor and Jasmine and Henna fluff- ease hair moisturizers and The Big Tease hair gel all contain organic jojoba oil to condition and give shine.</string>
			<string>It is the only natural, botanical substitute for spermaceti oil (obtained from the sperm whale) and it is also being investigated as a possible source of bio fuel. These types of liquid waxes have hundreds of uses and are very difficult to make synthetically. Whale oil used to be widely utilized across many industries - from lamp oil to soap making. Since the 1970s, pressure has been on to conserve whales and to eliminate the use of whale oil. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Our jojoba oil is cold pressed and organic and comes from a plantation located in Northwest Argentina. Brothers Adolfo and Alfredo along with Christian and others have grown the business during the past 20 years. Adolfo and Alfredo started as growers and farmers in the fields and have now developed the plantation into the largest jojoba crop in the world with the highest yield of oil.</string>
			<string>Adolfo and Alfredo still use traditional drip irrigation farming practices, which reduce water evaporation and conserve reserves. The oil that we buy from this source is fully traceable back to the very farm it is handpicked from during harvest time.</string>

			<string>Juniper is used to flavor food and drink and is the characteristic aroma in gin.</string>
			<string>Juniper berry oil has many properties, some of which are very beneficial to the skin. The antiseptic quality of the oil is very good for helping oily, spot-prone and acne skins.</string>
			<string>Juniper berry oil (Juniperus communis) has been known since ancient times as a very strong antiseptic and diuretic. It is traditionally used to help with urinary infections, respiratory problems, stomach complaints and contagious diseases. Its scent is refreshing and stimulates the mind.</string>
			<string>Used by therapists for oily and congested skin, acne and also very dry skin conditions. It is popular in acne treatments designed for adolescent boys, as they to prefer the refreshing and woody aroma to other more feminine smells. Juniper berry oil was used in Tibet years ago as incense, a disinfectant and to ward off &apos;evil spirits.&apos;</string>
			<string>It is currently in the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia for rheumatic pain and cystitis.</string>
			<string>We use juniper berry oil in our Miranda soap for its powerful action on oily, congested skin. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The oil is said to cleanse both mind and body.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We use it in our T’eo deodorant bar for its antiseptic qualities.</string>

			<string>Kaolin was also a traditional remedy for upset stomachs in South America and is still used in intestinal medicines today for its ability to absorb water.</string>
			<string>A versatile material, kaolin has a multitude of traditional and industrial uses. Most of the kaolin mined today is used for making paper, ceramics, and in the manufacture of make-up and skin care products.</string>
			<string>In cosmetics, kaolin cleanses and exfoliates dead skin cells and debris from the skin&apos;s surface. We use these qualities in our solid facial cleansers Aqua Marina and Herbalism.</string>
			<string>Kaolin adds absorbency, texture and bulk to cleansers, face masks, soaps and dusting powders.</string>

			<string>The cistus plant is a small shrub from the Cistaceae or rock-rose family. There are approximately twenty different species, growing all over the Mediterranean.</string>
			<string>Labdanum originates from the western Mediterranean, but can also be found in America.</string>
			<string>They are small shrubs that become covered in many flowers when they blossom. The leaves are evergreen and become coated in a sticky resin called labdanum. This resin protects the plants from the hot, sunny climate and dehydration; the resin appears as the temperature soars.</string>
			<string>Many materials are produced form the cistus plant, including labdanum resinoid, cistus oil and some other concretes and absolutes.</string>
			<string>The resinoid is obtained through a method called solvent extraction. It has a complex, earthy aroma. In perfumery labdanum resinoid is used as a fixative, sweetener, and blender.</string>

			<string>Lanolin is known as wool wax or wool fat. It is a soft, yellow, waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of sheep. Its purpose is to waterproof and protect the wool. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Chemically, lanolin is a complex mixture of esters, fatty acids and alcohols. Lanolin can be extracted from raw wool mechanically, by squeezing, but many methods in the past have used a chemical cocktail for this purpose. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Crude lanolin makes up between 5-25% of the weight of freshly shorn wool.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>

			<string>Lanolin is an excellent moisturizing ingredient for dry skin, as it emulsifies water on the skin and holds it there; its cushioning, plumping effect is noticeable. It is a perfect ingredient for barrier creams, baby lotions and eczema creams. It creates a protective film over the skin, allowing it to function and breathe naturally.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Medical grade lanolin is used as an ointment base, as the skin easily absorbs it. It facilitates the delivery of any medicinal ingredient it carries. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Lanolin can be used as an ingredient to soothe itchy or dry skin, in balms and glosses to treat chapped lips, and in hair conditioners to protect and coat the hair.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>We use lanolin in a number of our beautiful hair treatments for its protective qualities. We’ve added it to H’suan Wen H’ua and American Cream to coat and protect the hair follicles. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </string>

			<string>Lauryl betaine is a synthetic, vegetable-derived liquid. It is clear or pale yellow. It was first discovered as an extract of sugar beets.</string>
			<string>It is a hair and skin conditioner, a mild surface-active agent (surfactant) and works well in shampoo, shower gel or any cleansing product.</string>
			<string>Surfactants are part water-soluble and part oil-soluble, allowing the oil and water to become dispersed. Lauryl betaine is capable of carrying both a positive and a negative charge, making it a useful stabilizer.</string>
			<string>It improves quality and stability of foam, making it more durable in the presence of oil and dirt.</string>
			<string>The mildness of lauryl betaine (and its skin and hair conditioning properties) makes this an excellent ingredient to use across our range of shower gels, shampoos and bath products.</string>
			<string>We use it in combination with citrus oils in our Happy Hippy shower gel for its tough action against dirt. This leaves you feeling clean and uplifted every morning.</string>

			<string>The origin of lemon is not known, but it can be found growing in Asia and East India and Italy. We use organic Sicilian lemons, wherever possible, and buy these from our supplier in Sicily.</string>
			<string>Citrus limonum is a thorny, evergreen tree with irregular branches bearing glistening, oval leaves.</string>
			<string>Its flowers are white and pink-tinged and strongly perfumed, which become the lemon fruit.</string>
			<string>The word lemon stems from the Arabic, ‘laymun’ and the Persian, ‘limun.’</string>
			<string>Under the right conditions, a lemon tree can blossom every month and produce thousands of fruits per year.</string>
			<string>The Moors established Andalusian lemon orchards and introduced lemons to Sicily.</string>
			<string>Around the 11th century, crusaders from the East brought lemons to northern Europe. Columbus then firmly introduced the fruit into the western hemisphere.</string>
			<string>Lemon trees were planted in Florida when the Spanish settled there in the 1560s; two hundred years later, the Franciscan Fathers took seeds from Mexico to California, and today, most of the world’s commercial lemon production is concentrated in Italy, Sicily and California.</string>

			<string>The citrus aurantifolia tree, with its shrub-like appearance, pale green oval leaves, spiky branches and clusters of white flowers, is probably native to tropical regions of Asia. It is now widely grown in other tropical and subtropical areas of the world, especially in Brazil, Mexico and the West Indies.</string>
			<string>Its edible fruits are commonly picked when green and unripe - and are higher than lemon in both acid and sugar content when harvested this way. If allowed to ripen, they lose almost all of the acid content, turn yellowish and very sweet.</string>
			<string>Traditional healers in the tropics have used lime, its flowers, juice and pulp for centuries; particularly for insect bites, external infections, to cool the skin and added it to herbal teas and infusions for internal use as a decongestant – and to fight infection and intestinal complaints.</string>
			<string>Limes are a good source of vitamin C and are known as an effective antioxidant when eaten and when applied topically. Lime peel is candied and made into sweets in some countries, but it is also a source of the valuable lime essential oil. Lime oil is used as a flavoring agent in food and when added to cosmetics, it is said to improve circulation and mood.</string>
			<string>Lime’s beautiful, uplifting fragrance is valuable to perfumers as the whole oil, but the isolate citral, which is obtained from the oil, is sometimes used on its own or to enhance a citrus scent.</string>
			<string>Lime oil has a sharp, fresh, zesty scent. As with all citrus fruit, this fragrant oil is considered a top note, which means it evaporates first and it is therefore the first note that your olfactory system picks out of a blend. We have used lime oil in our You’ve Been Mangoed luxury bath melt and Each Peach (And Two’s a Pair) massage bar as part of their uplifting fruity fragrance.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists say that the scent of lime can bring about clarity and revitalize a tired mind. In general, citrus oils have been used to help with headaches and to aid concentration.</string>
			<string>Lime oil has been shown to be excellent at keeping bacteria at bay, which makes it useful for maintaining healthy skin. Our Enzymion moisturizer has lime oil for its astringency.</string>
			<string>Lime oil is a popular ingredient in remedies to combat congested skin, cellulite or simply to wake you up! It is often recommended for acne and for oily skins. We have used lime oil in our Ocean Salt face and body cleanser and Sea Vegetable soap for its zesty perfume and antioxidant quality.</string>
			<string>Lime oil has been traditionally used as an astringent and stimulating skin tonic in herbal and aromatherapeutic skin preparations.</string>

			<string>The lime tree (also known as linden) is one of approximately thirty species of ornamental trees native to the Northern Hemisphere; it is a natural hybrid between two varieties. This spreading tree has dark and shiny, heart-shaped leaves with yellow to white flowers. These appear in midsummer.</string>
			<string>Cleavers (Galium aparine, goosegrass, stickyweed, sticky Willy) is a climbing garden and hedgerow weed found in Europe and Asia. It is best known for its habit of sticking to anything that it touches with tenacious little hooks. The leaves grow in whorls, greenish white flowers bloom in June and July, followed by two-lobed bristly fruits. Cleavers belongs to the same family (Rubiacea) as the coffee plant, which explains why its seeds make a good coffee substitute. It is edible when cooked and used as a vegetable in China.</string>
			<string>Cleavers has traditionally been used in folk medicine to treat all skin disorders and was considered beneficial in the treatment of wounds, ulcers, and rashes. It is used by current herbalists for ulcers, skin inflammations, minor injuries and psoriasis.</string>
			<string>Listed in the German Pharmacopoeia, the lime tree flower contains flavonoids and other phytochemicals that may be behind the medical properties attributed to the plant.</string>
			<string>Linden flowers and leaves are mucilaginous, which makes them soothing when applied topically. The plant is also a natural astringent (which means it checks bleeding and constricts tissues).</string>
			<string>When making our decoction, we mash up the lime flowers and the cleavers, simmer them in water, then strain the mixture for use in our products.</string>

			<string>Liquorice sweets and medicines owe their characteristic color and taste to the rhizomes and roots of the liquorice plant.</string>
			<string>Liquorice is fifty times sweeter than sugar and able to mask unpleasant tastes. Used medicinally since at least the time of ancient Greeks, it is now an important medicine in its own right and is still used to treat coughs, stomach ulcers and other conditions today. It is of much interest to scientists due to its complex chemical make-up.</string>
			<string>Topically, it is antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and moisturizing. It has been used by herbalists to aid wound healing.</string>
			<string>The Latin name comes from the Greek words glukus and rhiza, meaning ‘sweet’ and ‘root’ respectively.</string>
			<string>Liquorice grows wild in Asia and southern Europe, but is mostly cultivated in the Mediterranean region. Liquorice in USA is usually flavoured with aniseed. Dutch, Nordic and Scandinavian countries like theirs salty or sour. Most of the world’s commercial production of liquorice is used to flavour tobacco.</string>
			<string>Liquorice sweets are made by boiling down the roots and concentrating the solution.</string>

			<string>Macadamia Ternifolia (also called the Queensland nut) is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal rainforests of Australia. The eminent Australian botanist, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, named it after Scottish chemist, John Macadam (1827 – 1865). Aborigines called the tree kindal kindal, and feasted on its rich flavored nuts.</string>
			<string>Macadamia trees thrive in volcanic soils. They are now grown commercially in Hawaii, where they were introduced in 1882. They are also cultivated in parts of Africa, South and Central America and Australia.</string>
			<string>The trees produce an abundance of fragrant white or pale pink, flowers, each of which may mature into up to twenty fruits. When mature, the leathery outer shell splits, freeing the hard-shelled, rounded nut.</string>
			<string>Their varied culinary and cosmetic uses mean that macadamia nuts are a sought-after and highly commercial crop.</string>
			<string>Macadamia nuts can be eaten as snacks, in salads and baked goods. Unroasted nuts should be eaten within two months.</string>
			<string>In cosmetics, macadamia nut oil is both emollient and moisturizing, and has a good oxidative stability. Our macadamia nuts are organic and grown without any chemicals, meaning that the oil is 100% organic.</string>
			<string>The nut is approximately 70% fat (among some of the highest found in nuts) and contains high levels of Omega-7 palmitoleic acid (a valuable fatty acid with antioxidant properties) as well as protein, niacin (Vitamin B3), iron, magnesium and thiamine (Vitamin B1).</string>
			<string>The oil is highly compatible with human skin and helps to promote healthy cell formation. Due to its nourishing and easily absorbed, consistency, it’s an ideal skin conditioner, which we have used in our hardcore exfoliating You Snap The Whip body butter.</string>
			<string>In hair products, it can smooth down the hair follicles, enhance shine and replace lost oils from hair and scalp, which makes it ideal for our Godiva 2-in-1 shampoo &amp;amp; conditioner bar.</string>

			<string>Mandarins are found on evergreen trees, which may grow up to 6 metres tall, belonging to the Rutaceae plant family. It has green leaves, white flowers and orange fruits. Though native to China, this plant is now cultivated across Europe.</string>
			<string>We buy our mandarins from Italy and Spain throughout the year. Mandarin gets its name from its traditional use as a gift to the Mandarins.</string>
			<string>The oil is one of the more gentle oils and is called ‘the children’s remedy’ in France.</string>
			<string>The mandarin juice shares its properties with the mandarin oil (Citrus reticulata) obtained from the fruit’s peel. It has been used for years to soothe the skin, freshen dull skin and to lighten the mood.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is an evergreen shrub, and may grow up to six feet tall. It has green, needle-like leaves and purple flowering tops. It is native to the Mediterranean and belongs to the Labiatae family. Depending on the local climate, it may bloom all year.</string>
			<string>Leaves and flowering tops are collected in spring and early summer. They are distilled for oil, or dried for infusions, decoctions, extracts, spirits, and tinctures. Rosemary is rich in volatile oils, flavonoids and phenolic acids, which are antiseptic and anti-inflammatory.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is used in cooking to flavour soups and stews. Powdered rosemary can be added to biscuits and preserves. Fresh sprigs can be steeped in vinegar, wine, or olive oil used to flavour dressings and sauces.</string>

			<string>Mango is a large, evergreen tree, thought to have originated in the Indo-Burma region and is now grown throughout the world. It has been cultivated for over 6,000 years.</string>
			<string>It bears small, fragrant yellow or red flowers, developing into a rich succulent fruit, which forms a vital food source for millions of people in the tropics.  </string>
			<string>Mango has a multitude of culinary uses, from being eaten fresh (either in its raw, bitter green form with a bit of salt,) or when ripe as a dessert fruit. The stone is a valued source of mango kernel butter.</string>
			<string>Mangoes are an excellent nutritional source, containing an abundance of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants - calcium, potassium, vitamin A, E and C and several B vitamins. Many studies have shown the health-promoting benefits of mango.</string>
			<string>Obtained from the seed kernel of the mango tree by cold-pressing, this luxurious butter is highly valued as a cosmetic base ingredient. It is softer in texture than cocoa butter and has beneficial moisturizing, lubricating and damage-repairing properties. It is particularly useful on neglected or sun-damaged skins in need of extra care. It can be used in a number of cosmetic preparations, from lip balm to body creams, and is a favoured ingredient in natural product ranges.</string>
			<string>We use mango butter in our You’ve Been Mangoed luxury bath melt. Its moisturizing action helps to soften the skin as you soak in the hot water.</string>

			<string>Calendula officinalis (pot marigold) is an ornamental and hardy plant, native to Central Europe and to the Mediterranean.</string>
			<string>It is cultivated across the globe due to its beautiful, orange, daisy-like flowers, which have been used in beverages, medicine, cosmetics, fabric colorants and foods.</string>
			<string>The name marigold is used for other plant species, too, such as tagetes, but these are no relation.</string>
			<string>Calendula was considered to possess magical properties. Ancient herbalists and pagans believed that it protected from evil.</string>
			<string>Saint Hildegard von Bingen is credited with not only writing about Calendula in one of the first pre-modern medical books, but with naming it ‘marigold’ in honour of the Virgin Mary, a portmanteau of Mary’s gold.</string>
			<string>Calendula was used to dress open wounds in the American civil war.</string>
			<string>Calendula’s effects are well documented across the centuries. Herbalists have used calendula to treat minor burns, frostbite and wounds.</string>
			<string>Calendula’s ability to soothe the skin makes it ideal in cosmetics, and it is mild enough for baby products. It can help reduce redness and calm the skin. It is thought to be effective in reducing the appearance of thread veins and broken capillaries.</string>
			<string>We use marigold flower petals in our Soak and Float shampoo bar to soothe the scalp as the hair is cleansed.</string>

			<string>Marshmallow (Althaea officinalis) is a tall plant that can be found growing in damp areas, such as meadows and marshes across Europe and Western Asia.</string>
			<string>Traditional healers and herbalists have used it since ancient times. Its botanical name derives from the Greek word ‘althein,’ which means ‘to heal.’</string>
			<string>The leaves and stem are covered in downy hairs, and the whole plant contains lubricating mucilage, particularly concentrated in the roots. The leaves are harvested in summer and the roots gathered in the autumn for use in various herbal remedies.</string>
			<string>The Egyptians mixed the viscous root mucilage with honey and made it into sweets.</string>
			<string>In the 19th century, doctors created a predecessor of the ‘marshmallow’ sweet we are familiar with today to treat children with sore throats; beating the juiced root, eggs, and sugar into a foam. The marshmallow sweets available today no longer contain the herb.</string>
			<string>For centuries, doctors and herbalists have used the roots and leaves of the plant medicinally to treat ailments, such as mouth irritation, coughs and asthma, or illnesses of the digestive system and urinary tract. Marshmallow tea can soothe sore throats, and capsules made from it can help with coughs, or even bronchitis.</string>

			<string>European meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria - also known as Filipendula ulmaria) is a perennial herb that grows in meadows, at the edges of ponds, on riverbanks and in damp woodlands. It produces a fragrant, brush-like cluster of small, pink or creamy white flowers, and is an important medicinal herb with a long history of use, ever since the Bronze Age.</string>
			<string>Meadowsweet is a source of salicylic acid, which was first isolated from this plant in 1838, later modified into acetylsalicylic acid and sold as ‘Aspirin.’ </string>
			<string>In herbal medicine, in its pure and isolated form, salicylic acid is harsh on the digestive system and can cause upset stomachs, or even internal bleeding. However, the whole herb contains properties to counteract the acidity. acetylsalicylic acid is gentler, and therefore safer, as an over-the-counter medicine.</string>
			<string>Traditional herbalists knew of meadowsweet’s usefulness as a treatment for fevers, colds and aches, and it was one of the sacred plants of the Druids.</string>
			<string>Meadowsweet is recommended as a soothing herb for various skin conditions and can help with rashes and irritation.</string>
			<string>We make our infusion with dried, cut leaves and stems steeped in boiled water.</string>
			<string>Meadowsweet’s anti-inflammatory, tightening, toning and astringent properties make it the perfect ingredient for a firming skin cream.</string>

			<string>Methylparaben is an ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is a fine crystalline powder, which is odorless, tasteless and non-irritating.</string>
			<string>Parabens are some of the oldest cosmetic preservatives and have been used since the 1920s.</string>
			<string>They are used globally and are permitted by every world health authority (500 independent safety studies have been carried out over the decades). Scare-mongering ‘studies’ into their potentially negative effects have now been widely debunked.</string>
			<string>Parabens occur naturally in some fruits and vegetables, including blueberries.</string>
			<string>Methylparaben is used to control the growth of bacteria, yeasts and moulds. We use less than half the maximum permitted level to ensure the product is as mild as possible and the skin&apos;s natural microflora is not affected. This low level of use also helps with the bio-degradability of our product and any waste material created during manufacture.</string>
			<string>We formulate our products without preservatives wherever possible. 73% of LUSH products are unpreserved. Our products are really fresh, and we even tell you when we made them.</string>
			<string>Conventional cosmetic shelf life is around 30 months. Our products can have shelf lives as little as three weeks, but are usually around 14 months. We even ask that you store our Fresh Face Masks and The Hair Doctor in the fridge.</string>
			<string>We assess the need for preservatives by considering many factors. The type of product, its structure, manufacturing process, ingredients and application. Using this information and microbiological tests during the products&apos; development, we then choose the appropriate preservative. At this point, the decision may be made to use one of the parabens, which increases the protection from microbial growth.</string>
			<string>The parabens are still the safest and mildest we can find. We constantly review and investigate cosmetic preservatives, and we consider any sound scientific evidence. They are safe to handle during manufacture and guarantee the quality and safety of the products we want our customers to enjoy.</string>
			<string>We use methylparaben in our products that require preservatives to keep them fresher for longer. Methylparaben can be found in extremely low quantities in our Daddy-O and H’Suan Wen H’ua shampoos, and across our entire range of products sold in bottles and pots.</string>

			<string>Myrrh is a resin produced by small sturdy trees. These grow to no more than 9 feet in height and inhabit the semi-desert regions of Yemen, Libya, and Iran. They can also be found along the coast of the Red Sea. Because the myrrh trees are from the same botanical family as frankincense (Burseraceae), they share a number of similar features.</string>
			<string>Most of the internationally traded myrrh is produced in the Southern Arabic peninsular (Oman and Yemen) and Northeast Africa (Somalia).</string>
			<string>Myrrh has been used throughout human history as an ingredient in incense and perfumery for its rich, amber-incense aroma. In ancient times, it was often worth more than gold.</string>
			<string>The origin of the word myrrh is from the Arabic term ‘murr,’ meaning bitter. Its yellow liquid is extracted from natural cracks or cuts in the trunk; this then sets in to brownish-red pieces. Steam distillation is used to extract the essential oil from the resin. Most myrrh, however, is used as a resinoid, which is obtained by solvent extraction. When burnt, it expands and blooms, rather than melting.</string>
			<string>It has been used extensively for its apparent medicinal and rejuvenating qualities, even when there were no scientific means with which to test its properties. It was used by the ancient Egyptians in religious rites and as a preservative in the mummification process.</string>
			<string>Myrrh has been shown to be antiseptic, astringent, carminative and anti-inflammatory; in modern medicine, it is used in pharmaceutical and dental preparations. It has been used to treat wounds and conditions such as athlete’s foot. It is highly effective in treating ulcers and gum problems, making it a popular ingredient in toothpastes.</string>

			<string>Americans and Europeans prefer yoghurt made from cow’s milk, but in Egypt, it is common to make it from the milk of the water buffalo.</string>
			<string>The origin of yoghurt is mysterious. As we know it today, yoghurt was probably first made in either the Balkans or Turkey, but soured milk products were known to the Ancients, too.</string>

			<string>Neroli oil is extracted from the blossoms of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium amara), which belongs to the Rutaceae plant family. They are hardy citrus plants. They are evergreen and grow up to 20 feet in the wild. In cultivation, they will only grow to half this height. The tree bears double leaves, which have a bulge at the base of the main leaf.&lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Its fruit is used to flavor liqueurs, such as Grand Mariner and Triple sec, and its leaves and twigs provide the petitgrain oil (sometimes also called bigarade), another aromatic ingredient we use.</string>
			<string>Neroli originates from Asia, but is now produced all over the world in the Mediterranean, North Africa and China. The oil produced in France and Tunisia is believed to be the finest of them all. We use the Tunisian quality, believing it to be the best available.</string>
			<string>Neroli is one of the few essential oils to be scientifically proven to increase serotonin production in the brain. As with all aromatherapy, however, the power of suggestion and individual preferences play an important part in how effective this might be. Serotonin is an important, mood-altering neurotransmitter, and increased levels of it enhance our feelings of serenity and well-being. It is believed that the tradition of bridal orange blossom garlands started because the fragrance soothed the nerves of the young brides.</string>
			<string>Neroli oil is reported to improve the tone and texture of skin. Aromatherapists have used it for many years to help reduce the appearance of scarring and stretch marks.</string>
			<string>Some essential oils are classed as synergistic in aromatherapy. This means that, when mixed, oils take on the characteristics of each other and have a stronger effect on the body. Neroli and lavender are reputed to have a strengthening effect on the elasticity of the skin.</string>
			<string>We are among the top three buyers of Tunisian Neroli oil.</string>
			<string>Neroli has an intensely sharp, green and floral aroma, which comes alive when diluted and imparts a refreshing scent. We have used it in our Breath of God fine fragrance.</string>
			<string>We use neroli oil in both our Gorgeous and Skin Drink moisturizers for the aroma and toning effect on the skin.</string>
			<string>Our Prince Triple Orange Blossom shaving cream contains neroli oil, helping to tone the skin and soothe after a close shave.</string>

			<string>The stinging nettle is part of a genus of about 45 plants and it is widespread worldwide. Nettles grow almost anywhere, apart from tropical and arctic regions. They enjoy cultivated, nitrogen-rich soil and thrive in slightly moist conditions in full sun or partial shade.</string>
			<string>The plant is rich in iron and vitamins A and C. It is also used as a commercial source of chlorophyll to colour cosmetics, foods and medicines.</string>
			<string>Young leaves can be picked off for culinary uses – these should be blanched or cooked and can be used like spinach. Nettle is used to wrap some cheeses; it is made into soups, baked into bread dough and used in herbal beer. The leaves are dried and used for teas and tonics.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is an evergreen shrub, and may grow up to six feet tall. It has green, needle-like leaves and purple flowering tops. It is native to the Mediterranean and belongs to the Labiatae family.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is cultivated for perfumery, as well as ornamental, culinary, and medical usage.</string>
			<string>In cosmetics, rosemary is used in bath preparations, and as a hair tonic.</string>
			<string>We add dried nettle leaves and rosemary to hot, boiled water to make our infusion. This is strained and added to our Recon hair treatment. It stimulates and soothes the scalp.</string>

			<string>The stinging nettle is part of a genus of about 45 plants and it is widespread worldwide. The stinging nettle is known by the small stinging hairs on its leaves and stem - its Latin name Urtica was given to the plant by the Romans (from the word urere, ‘to burn’).</string>
			<string>The plant is rich in iron and vitamins A and C. It is also used as a commercial source of chlorophyll.</string>
			<string>Nettle has been a popular remedy for anaemia due to its iron content. It has also been traditionally used to alleviate various skin and scalp conditions and herbalists believe it stimulates new hair growth and helps prevent hair loss.</string>
			<string>Rosmarinus officinalis is also known as sea rose, compass plant and Mary’s tree. This aromatic evergreen shrub of the mint family is native to the Mediterranean region.</string>
			<string>Leaves and flowering tops of rosemary are collected in spring and early summer, and are distilled for oil, or dried for infusions, decoctions, extracts, spirits, and tinctures.</string>
			<string>Rosemary is rich in volatile oils, flavonoids and phenolic acids, which are antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. These properties make rosemary particularly useful for spot-prone problem skins and flaky, itchy scalps.</string>
			<string>Vinegars are a combination of various acids including acetic acid. Rice vinegar is made by fermenting rice. Acetic acid occurs naturally in some plant and animal tissues. It is a traditional cooking ingredient, which is especially important in sweet and sour dishes.</string>
			<string>Acetic acid and vinegars are common cosmetics ingredients. They are used in shampoos, mouthwashes and skin creams. Many people throughout history have attributed health benefits to vinegar. Various vinegars have been used to wash acne skin, improve scalp health and to brighten the complexion. Japanese women have relied on vinegar as a beauty aid for centuries.</string>

			<string>Olibanum is also called frankincense. It is obtained by means of steam distillation from the resin of Boswellia carterii. It is pale yellow and resinous with a fresh, fruity and woody aroma.</string>
			<string>Olibanum trees can be found growing in Ethiopia, Somalia and generally in the regions surrounding the Red Sea.</string>
			<string>The resin was one of the earliest perfume materials used - first burned as incense and used in religious ceremonies by ancient civilizations pre-dating the Egyptians. It continued to be important during religious ceremonies and was believed to cleanse the air, ward off evil spirits and calm the environment.</string>
			<string>By the time of the Pharaohs, myrrh and olibanum (also known as the incense trees) had become extremely valued. Ancient Egyptians used olibanum in the embalming process.</string>
			<string>The main constituents of olibanum oil are α-pinene and limonene, which make it astringent, expectorant and antiseptic. Therefore it is often used on the skin, for respiratory problems and to fight infection.</string>
			<string>Olibanum oil has a woody, spicy fragrance with hint of lemon. It is traditionally used for meditation, as it is believed to slow breathing, while also encouraging deeper breaths.</string>
			<string>It covers the skin with a thin protective film, which softens and minimizes the appearance of fine lines. It is effective on sore, cracked, de-hydrated skins, such as eczema-prone, dry and mature skins.</string>
			<string>Its toning and antiseptic effects help keep skin clear of occasional spots and blemishes.</string>

			<string>The olive tree (Olea europaea) is part of a large family, which includes Jasmine and Lilac. The tree has a thick trunk and gnarled, grey bark. It can grow fairly tall, but they are often pruned to a shorter height for ease of harvesting. The leaves of the tree have silvery grey undersides and are used for teas, decoctions and extracts.</string>
			<string>The word ‘olive’ can be traced back to many ancient languages, its current forms rooted in Latin (oliva) and Greek (elaia). Olive trees are native to the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor and Syria, and can live for thousands of years.</string>
			<string>The commercial producers of olive oil today are Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia and Australia. Harvesting usually involves shaking the fruits from the trees using poles, after which the best olives are selected and processed. Though laborious compared to mechanical labour, hand harvesting remains the popular method.</string>
			<string>Extra virgin preserves the most flavor and nutrients and that beautiful, green tint. Other grades include virgin, pure, 100% olive and others.</string>
			<string>Consumption of olive oil has been shown to regulate levels of bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.</string>
			<string>The oil’s active ingredients are vitamin E (a fat soluble antioxidant), oleic acid (omega 9 monounsaturated fatty acid), hydroxytyrosol (plant polyphenol) and squalene (an organic compound found in human sebum).</string>
			<string>Hydroxytyrosol is a plant polyphenol found abundantly in olives and olive oil. It is thought to be one of the most powerful antioxidants in the world; some would say it claims the top spot! Squalene is often isolated from shark liver oil and used as a valued ingredient in many modern creams and ointments. Olives are one of the best alternative botanical sources, as they contain unusually high levels of the substance.</string>
			<string>The oil’s composition makes it ideally suited to shield skin from free radical activity. It can help prevent discoloration and damage. Extra virgin olive oil is used in our Marilyn and Retread hair products, helping to increase the tensile strength of hair and gently treating the scalp.</string>
			<string>Our Gorgeous face moisturizer has a high content of extra virgin olive oil, adding to the perfectly balanced formula of easily absorbed and nutritious ingredients. Dream Cream is rich in extra virgin olive oil, creating a non-greasy formula to care for your skin.</string>
			<string>Extra virgin olive oil, which retains most of the active and health promoting properties, is used in our Lip Service, Honey Trap and Whipstick lip balms. With other tasty ingredients, our balms are lip-smackingly delicious and good for your pout, too.</string>
			<string>We use the organic extra virgin oil for its vitamins and antioxidant properties in our Imperialis as well as Dream Cream body lotion.</string>

			<string>Orange blossom absolute, also referred to as orange flower absolute, is extracted from the blossoms of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium amara) by means of solvent extraction. It is dark orange in color and much thicker than neroli oil, which is extracted from orange blossoms by a different method.</string>
			<string>It belongs to the Rutaceae plant family and is a hardy citrus plant. They are evergreen and grow up to 20 feet in the wild. In cultivation, they will only grow to half this height. The tree bears double leaves, which have a bulge at the base of the main leaf.</string>
			<string>Its fruit is used to flavour liqueurs, such as Grand Mariner and Triple sec, and its leaves and twigs provide the petitgrain oil (sometimes also called bigarade), another aromatic ingredient we use.</string>
			<string>It is believed that the tradition of bridal orange blossom garlands started because the fragrance soothed the nerves of the young brides before retiring to the marital bed.</string>
			<string>It has an intensely floral aroma, and although expensive, it is one of the most popular essential oils used in perfumery.</string>

			<string>The orange tree (Citrus aurantium dulcis) is a flowering tree with glossy, evergreen leaves and thorny branches. Its beautiful white flowers are fragrant and its fruits are juicy, orange berries called hesperidium. It is thought to be native to China and the Far East.</string>
			<string>The bright colour of the fruits made them very popular, favoured especially by royalty. They are thought to be the fabled ‘golden apples’ grown in the garden of Hesperides in Greek mythology. They have since featured in many cultural traditions to symbolize fertility, prosperity and good luck.</string>
			<string>Though the Arab traders brought bitter oranges to Europe, the Portuguese introduced the sweet orange in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. This became the favoured choice, as it was far more palatable. Columbus brought introduced the orange to the western hemisphere along with other citrus fruits.</string>
			<string>Today, the main producers of sweet orange are Brazil, United States, Spain and Italy. Most of the oranges grown in United States come from Florida and California.</string>
			<string>The peel and its white pith contain an important flavonoid called hesperedin, which h,is being studied by scientists for its antioxidant and antifungal properties.</string>
			<string>The peel is a source of sweet orange essential oil and isolates used in perfumery (limonene, citral, etc). Aromatherapists use orange oil to uplift mood and recommend as a cheerful scent for dark winter days.</string>
			<string>Sexy Peel soap was inspired by delicious marmalade, and we’ve added several types of citrus peel and juice to it – one of the most refreshing ways to start your day.

			<string>The tropical evergreen cashew tree is native to the West Indies and Brazil. It is a medium-sized tree, growing up to forty feet tall.</string>
			<string>In the sixteenth century, Portuguese explorers carried the cashew from Brazil to India where it adapted well to the climate.</string>
			<string>The nut is rich in oil and distinctively flavored. It is commonly used in South and South-East Asian cuisine.</string>
			<string>The nut is actually the seed of the fleshy cashew apple, which is pear shaped and reddish or yellow.</string>
			<string>Unusually, instead of being on the inside, the nut hangs like an appendage from the base. The flesh is reported to be even tastier than the cashew, but spoils within 24 hours of harvest, meaning that it is rarely exported.</string>
			<string>Between the layers of the nut’s two shells, there is an oil that can blister human skin, much like its relative, the poison ivy. The fruits are picked by hand and the nuts detached to be processed.</string>
			<string>They are roasted at 350 degrees, cooled, and then the hardened shells are removed by hand, now that the caustic oil has been burnt off.</string>
			<string>Turning the nuts into ‘butter’ is a relatively simple process and involves lightly roasting the nuts and milling them to the correct consistency.</string>
			<string>We use organic cashew nuts from a fair trade co-operative project in India. They are then shipped to Cornwall and the nuts are turned into cashew nut butter.</string>
			<string>Organic cashew nut butter is moisturizing on the skin and we use it along side other organic butters in our Handy Gurugu hand cream.</string>

			<string>Castor oil is derived from the seed of the Ricinus communis plant. It is well tolerated by the skin and used as carrier oil, skin conditioning agent and an emulsion stabilizer in cosmetics.</string>
			<string>The evergreen castor bean shrub is considered native to eastern Africa. It is cultivated in southern Asia, Africa and other hot parts of the world. The seeds are collected when almost ripe and allowed to mature in the sun.</string>
			<string>It is mainly made up of ricinoleic acid; the oil is produced by cold-pressing the seeds and goes through a clarification process by heat before use. The seeds contain ricin, which is poisonous, but it does not absorb into the expressed oil. The oil is a colorless, odorless and tasteless pale yellow liquid.</string>
			<string>Castor oil and its derivatives are widely used in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, waxes, nylons, pharmaceuticals and perfumes, amongst others.</string>
			<string>The oil also contains undecylenic acid, which is a powerful answer to dermal fungus. In 1961, in the journal of American Oil Chemists’ Society, A.F. Novak documented the antimicrobial properties of the two main derivatives of castor oil: ricinoleic and oleic acids. He found that these two substances were superior in their activity against several species of bacteria, yeasts and moulds.</string>
			<string>Traditional uses of castor oil include the treatment of skin problems, burns, sunburns, skin disorders, skin cuts, abrasions, etc. It has also been used to draw out sties in the eye by pouring a small amount and allowing it to circulate around the inside of the eyelid. The oil has similarly been used in a soaked flannel and placed on the body to cure various ailments, such as headaches, muscle pains, and skin complaints.</string>
			<string>Vegetable oils are favourable alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants due to their emollient property and biodegradability. Castor oil has better high temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it ideal for use in cosmetics.</string>
			<string>Castor oil has been used medicinally around the world for 4,000 years and is featured in Indian and Chinese herbalism.</string>

			<string>The common pumpkin (Cucurbita) is native to the Americas, familiar to us today as the Halloween pumpkin and as the main ingredient of the North American dessert, pumpkin pie. It belongs to the cucumber (Cucurbitaceae) family and was one of the staple foods and medicinal plants of the Native Americans.</string>
			<string>The fruits range from yellow to bright orange in color and can grow very large and heavy - the current record being 766kg. There are many annual record-breaking attempts - from growing the largest to how fast one can carve a face into a pumpkin. (Can you beat 24 seconds?)</string>
			<string>The edible flesh, encased in a tough outer shell, contains inner membrane and seeds, both of which are removed before preparing pumpkin dishes or carving Jack-o’-lanterns. The seeds are usually coated in a thin husk (although huskless varieties exist) and are extremely nutritious. In Mexico, they are called pepitas and used as a thickener and flavoring in foods.</string>
			<string>Pumpkin seeds have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Native Americans treated male prostate gland, urinary tract and intestinal problems by eating pumpkin seeds, and the German and US pharmacopoeias have featured pumpkin seeds (Cucurbitae peponis semen) as treatment for human parasitic worms. Today, pumpkin seed oil is under investigation for use in the treatment of these conditions.</string>
			<string>Pumpkin seeds have a strong, distinct and nutty flavour, and can be toasted or eaten as is once shelled. Organic pumpkin seed butter contains all of the seeds’ nutrition and it is a popular vegan food. Our organic pumpkin seed butter is natural and remains free of chemicals.</string>
			<string>Pumpkin seeds contain zinc, magnesium, carotenoids and a good balance of essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6.) They are also very high in vitamin E, which makes them suitable for use in cosmetics. Vitamin E is believed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain relieving) properties.</string>
			<string>Studies also suggest that topical application of pumpkin seed oil may decrease skin roughness, dryness and fine lines. The antioxidant action of vitamin E is also of great interest to manufacturers of cosmetics - antioxidants act as preservatives in the product, greatly increasing shelf life - but, most importantly, they also provide real benefits to the surface layers of our skin.</string>
			<string>The constituents of pumpkin seeds may explain why the oil expressed from them has been traditionally popular for rough, dry, scarred or damaged skin.</string>

			<string>Glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate is a combination of two emulsifying (and emulsion stabilizing) ingredients. Glyceryl stearate is a solid and waxy compound. It is made by reacting glycerine (a soap by-product) with stearic acid (a naturally occurring, vegetable fatty acid). PEG-100 stearate is an off-white, solid ester of polyethylene glycol (a binder and a softener) and stearic acid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surfactant qualities of glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate allow oil and water to mix. The stabilizing effect of these two ingredients means that the product remains blended and will not separate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creams and lotions are water and oil droplets held together by materials called emulsifiers, without them oil droplets would float on top of the water. When formulating our creams and lotions, we carefully consider the levels of fatty acids in other materials (such as cocoa and shea butters).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When used in a moisturizer, this forms a protective barrier on the surface of skin, greatly assisting moisture retention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&apos;ve also used glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 combination in our innovative Jungle solid hair conditioner. The emulsifying qualities enable fresh ingredients to be emulsified with softening cocoa butter and soya lecithin. The result is an effective product, which detangles the hair, and leaves it in excellent condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solid conditioners are very environmentally friendly. To date, we have saved the use of three million bottles (equivalent to ninety tonnes of plastic) because our customers have chosen to use our solid shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br&gt;</string>

			<string>It consists of very mild surface active agents, also known as surfactants, derived from natural ingredients like almond and coconut oils.</string>
			<string>Surfactants have two distinct parts to their structure – a hydrophilic head that likes to mix with water and a hydrophobic tail that likes to mix with oils. This system allows the surfactant to disperse fats and oils in water and prevent separation.</string>
			<string>As it is a blend of non-ionic surfactants, the glycerides are very stable and thus do not cause irritation when they comes into contact with the skin.</string>

			<string>Native to tropical South America, the peanut bush belongs to the legume family. It is, therefore, related to beans rather than nuts. Unlike beans, however, the seeds store fat instead of starch, making them more nut-like.</string>
			<string>The name peanut comes from the plant being a member of the pea family and the seeds looking like nuts. Because the rounded, oblong shells grow underground from a special stalk, they are often called groundnuts. The stalk forms after pollination.</string>
			<string>The nuts are harvested by lifting the whole plant out of the soil. The seedpods are dried in the sun. The plant is then either returned to the soil or used as animal feed.</string>
			<string>The nut itself is 50% oil.</string>
			<string>Peanuts are roasted and sold as snacks, or made into oil, peanut butter and flour.</string>
			<string>Most of the peanuts in the USA are made into peanut butter, a national favorite. An early 20th century scientist, George Washington Carver, developed hundreds of uses for peanuts and has sometimes been credited with the concept of using peanut oil for cosmetic purposes.</string>
			<string>Peanuts are one of the most calorific and nutritious foods – they contain protein, vitamin E and, minerals including zinc, magnesium and potassium.</string>
			<string>Peanut oil is both moisturizing and protective. Its emollient qualities work well with sebum and lift off impurities in a very gentle way.</string>

			<string>Our fragrances are made up of approximately 60% natural oils, resins and absolutes. Some formulas are 100% natural, some less so, depending on the product in question.</string>
			<string>Many of our fragrances are formulated to add treatment properties to the product; for example, chamomile blue has a high azulene content, which has a soothing effect on the skin and studies show it to have anti-inflammatory properties.</string>
			<string>Every natural essential oil is made up of a complex mixture of chemicals. Plants are little chemical factories and produce oils in order to fight disease, attract pollinators and perform many other functions.</string>
			<string>Some of the chemicals in natural essential oils are formed during processing of the material and did not exist in the plant to start off with. This is the case with orris butter, which starts its life as the rhizome of an iris plant, but ends up as one of the most valuable perfumery materials in use today through long drying and processing.</string>
			<string>Citrus oils tend to be fairly simple and are easy to mimic using synthetics. We prefer using the real thing.</string>
			<string>Rose oil and rose absolute are expensive and chemically complex, with around 350 components making up the whole oil.</string>
			<string>In traditional perfumery and particularly the manufacture of soap and bath product fragrances, natural materials are usually omitted in favour of cheaper synthetics.</string>
			<string>We like to start with natural oils and build up fragrances around them, using synthetic materials to support the formulae.</string>
			<string>The synthetic ingredients we use may be existing components of materials. For example, adding geraniol to a rose and geranium fragrance will tie together the &apos;chemical daisy chain&apos; because both of these natural materials contain geraniol.</string>
			<string>We also use synthetic musk and some aromas that are impossible to obtain from nature, e.g. for pineapple scents.</string>

			<string>Petitgrain oil is produced from the leaves and twigs of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium amara), a member of the Rutaceae plant family. These evergreen trees can grow up to 20 feet in the wild, but will only grow to half this height in cultivation. They are the hardiest of all the citrus plants and are often used when grafting other citrus trees to make them suitable for harsher conditions.</string>
			<string>The tree produces a distinctive &apos;double leaf&apos;, which has a small bulge at the base of the main leaf.</string>
			<string>Its fruit is used to flavour liqueurs, such as Grand Mariner and Triple sec, and its flowers provide neroli and orange blossom oils, which we also love to use.</string>
			<string>The oil is a pale yellow to clear liquid, and has a fresh, green and woody aroma.</string>
			<string>Petitgrain is used in food and flavourings, as well as in the perfume industry.</string>
			<string>This is one of the classic ingredients of Eau de Cologne.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists often use it interchangeably with orange blossom and neroli for stress and nervous exhaustion.</string>

			<string>When the nuts are ripe, they can be picked and cold-pressed to create walnut oil. In some countries, this is used as cooking oil.</string>
			<string>Walnut oil is vitamin rich and moisturizing, as well as an antiseptic, and said to help with many dry skin conditions.</string>

			<string>Propylene glycol is a clear, colorless, syrupy liquid, which is odorless and tasteless. It is a synthetic liquid, absorbs moisture and is completely soluble in water. Propylene glycol comes from petrochemical sources.</string>
			<string>Propylene glycol is used in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. It has many uses and is a very versatile substance. This wide use means that much is known about the safety of this material. Propylene glycol, for example, is used in anti-freeze.</string>
			<string>It is recognized as safe for use in foods, cosmetics and medicines. There have been no health concerns relating to it over the decades we have used it, or at any time.</string>
			<string>Propylene glycol is a humectant, which means it helps the skin to absorb moisture. Its property of absorbing moisture allows it to do this. It helps to carry the water-based ingredients into the skin. In hair care products, it softens the hair and allows it to be combed through easily.</string>
			<string>We use propylene glycol in our soaps to soften the skin, balancing the cleansing effect of the soap. We call this our ‘hot soap’, as it requires heat in the manufacturing process. The heat melts the ingredients, which are poured in to moulds and are left to set solid. We also make ‘cold soaps’, which are mixtures of ingredients pressed together to form their shape with no heat involved.</string>
			<string>Stan Krysztal invented the ‘hot soap’ base. Stan was a great inventor and teacher who also worked on the shampoo bar base. His expertise lives on in so many of our products and we are greatly indebted to him. Stan’s choice of ingredients, including propylene glycol, was based on his vast knowledge of cosmetics. His career as a Cosmetic Chemist spanned 51 years from 1935 to 1992, when he passed away at the age of 86. The majority of our soaps are made with this principle.</string>
			<string>We use propylene glycol in hair products. In our Veganese and Coolaulin conditioners, it allows the hair to be combed through more easily. In shampoo, it helps to smooth the hair after the shampoo base has cleansed it thoroughly. In combination with effective oils - such as olive, almond and jojoba - this helps to repair damage, increase tensile strength and protect the hair from dryness.</string>
			<string>Our Sweetie Pie and The Joy of Jelly shower jellies are made with propylene glycol. It balances the cleansing effect of the shampoo bases and works with the fruit and flower infusions of coconut, pineapple, tiger lily and rose. Propylene glycol does not freeze, so the jelly retains its texture in the fridge or freezer.</string>
			<string>We use propylene glycol in moisturizers. In our Skin Drink facial moisturizer, it carries the rose petal infusion and aloe vera decoction into the skin.</string>

			<string>Propylparaben is an ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is a white, fine crystalline powder, which is odorless, tasteless and non-irritating.</string>
			<string>Parabens are some of the oldest cosmetic preservatives and have been used since the 1920s.</string>
			<string>They are used globally and are permitted by every world health authority (500 independent safety studies have been carried out over the decades).</string>
			<string>Propylparaben is used to control the growth of bacteria, yeasts and moulds. (Just like methylparaben.) We use less than half the maximum permitted level to ensure the product is as mild as possible and the skin’s natural microflora is not affected.</string>
			<string>This low level of use also helps with the bio-degradability of our product and any waste material created during manufacture.</string>
			<string>We formulate our products without preservatives wherever possible. 73% of LUSH products are unpreserved. Our products are really fresh, and we even tell you when we made them.</string>
			<string>Conventional cosmetic shelf life is around 30 months. Our products can have shelf lives as little as three weeks, but are usually around 14 months.</string>
			<string>We assess the need for preservatives by considering many factors. The type of product, its structure, manufacturing process, ingredients and application. Using this information and microbiological tests during the products&apos; development, we then choose the appropriate preservative. At this point, the decision may be made to use one of the parabens, which increases the protection from microbial growth.</string>
			<string>The parabens are still the safest and mildest we can find. We constantly review and investigate cosmetic preservatives, and we consider any sound scientific evidence. They are safe to handle during manufacture and guarantee the quality and safety of the products we want our customers to enjoy.</string>

			<string>Rapeseed oil; Coconut oil (Brassica napus and Cocos nucifera): these oils are both used in our new palm-free soap base. Traditional soap making relies heavily on animal tallow. It is still the core ingredient in some of the world&apos;s best-selling soap brands because it&apos;s very cheap and easy to obtain. We obviously don&apos;t want to use tallow, so we&apos;ve always made our soaps using vegetable oils instead.</string>
			<string>Vegetable soap science was developed with palm oil - a resource that, at the time, wasn&apos;t as widely used as it is today. Palm oil is added to so many common products, from margarine to ready-meals, that its worldwide usage has become unsustainable. Development of bio-fuels from palm oil is adding to the problem.</string>
			<string>Palm oil plantations cause severe deforestation, problems for indigenous populations and the animals that live there. Until the worldwide reliance of palm oil is drastically reduced, there really is no such thing as sustainable palm oil at present.</string>
			<string>Cosmetic companies are responsible for approximately 7% of the world&apos;s palm oil usage. In 2007, we felt that it was time for us to re-invent our vegetable soap base and make it palm oil-free. This would stop us from using approximately 250,000kg of palm oil a year. It was a very ambitious task and we&apos;ve had to work hard to get the formula right. We needed vast quantities of good soap, so the new formula had to be commercially viable and we did not want the quality of our soaps to be affected.</string>
			<string>We worked with a leading UK soap-base manufacturer and developed a sunflower, rapeseed and coconut oil-base. We&apos;ve now settled on a new formula with just rapeseed and coconut oil, as we feel this gives our soap the properties we want.</string>
			<string>The oils are heated with sodium hydroxide and water, which results in a process known as saponification. The ‘soap’ can then be separated from the mixture using salt, and dried to give the solid, unpreserved base that we use in production.</string>
			<string>Glycerine is a traditional by-product of soap making and has humectant properties. It is usually removed, but we add it back into the mix for its moisturizing properties. This is one of the reasons that our soaps are so beautiful on the skin.</string>
			<string>Once the finished base has made it to the LUSH kitchens, we add a whole range of different materials to make our unique range of soaps. Everything from fresh fruit and herbs to exciting oils, sparkling glitters and gentle exfoliators are stirred in to create the big blocks of solid soaps that you can see piled high in our shops around the world.</string>
			<string>We use this pioneering new soap base in Turkish Delight, Summer Pudding and the rest of our handmade soaps.</string>

			<string>Mentioned in the Bible and used by the ancient Egyptians as a decorative cosmetic, henna is enjoying renewed popularity as an alternative to synthetic hair dyes.</string>
			<string>There have been tomb findings of henna markings on mummies and some evidence of Bronze Age ritual use exists.</string>
			<string>Made from the dried and powdered leaves of the Lawsonia inermis tree, henna starts out as green, but imparts a warm reddish-brown color. The active coloring ingredient is called lawsone. Henna can be mixed with coffee, indigo and other natural dyes to manipulate the final shade.</string>
			<string>Henna is also hair conditioning in its own right and sometimes used for this purpose in hair moisturizers and other products. It coats the hair with a fine film and adds body, shine and brilliant highlights.</string>
			<string>Growing across the Middle East, Asia and sub-tropical Africa, henna use has spread around the world from these regions due to migration.</string>
			<string>Henna is also used in many traditional body adornments and is particularly important in religious wedding rituals. It was believed to have healing and spiritual properties and henna body painting is considered an important art form even today.</string>
			<string>Helen Ambrosen invented a clever new way of presenting henna hair dye; instead of a messy and difficult to control powder, our henna is blended with nourishing cocoa butter and other natural ingredients and pressed into blocks. This makes the product easier to display without packaging and has additional benefits: the cocoa butter conditions and lemon juice adds shine and helps to develop the color.</string>

The clay is removed by pick-axe, loaded into a cart and hand pushed on rails by two men. This is a very hard process with only a small amount of light from hand-held lamps. It is then taken to the treatment area and washed in water to eliminate impurities, then laid out to dry in the sun.</string>
			<string>It is then taken to the factory in Fes to be washed again where the water is purer. It is sold either in lump or chip form, or ground into powder. At present, we purchase the powdered form.</string>
			<string>Rhassoul is a natural mineral product that also has a foaming effect, grease remover property and acts as a natural shampoo. Mixed with tepid water, it makes a mud that can be applied as a poultice on ankles, calves, thighs, hips and the stomach. It can be used internally for upset stomachs and by pregnant women for gastric acidity.</string>
			<string>A miner survived being buried for twelve days by eating the rhassoul mud and drinking from his lamp.</string>
			<string>Our supplier has built a village for approximately 500 people, including a school. They provide facilities for the workers at the mines, such as living accommodation, social rooms, doctor’s surgery, on site ambulance and Mosque.</string>
			<string>We use rhassoul mud in our Honey Bee Bath Bomb to soften and cleanse the skin.</string>
			<string>Our Dark Angels cleanser contains rhassoul mud for its cleansing and de-greasing qualities.</string>

			<string>Rice bran oil is obtained from the outer layer of the rice kernel (the bran). This light golden oil gives soap a rich, creamy texture, but also has many benefits for the skin. It is excellent for sensitive skins due to its moisturizing and exfoliant properties.</string>
			<string>Phytic acid is present within the oil. It is a B vitamin complex and it is said to stimulate circulation and cell growth, revealing brighter skin.</string>
			<string>Squalene is found in high quantities in rice bran oil. Squalene actually makes up 12% of human sebum, the skin’s natural moisturiser, and is produced in the liver.</string>
			<string>Due to its squalene content, rice bran oil has been found to be effective in the treatment of very dry and aging skin, with particular improvement in the condition of severe dermatitis.</string>
			<string>Studies have shown that squalene stimulates the healing process through oxidisation.</string>
			<string>Rice bran oil is a natural sunscreen and contains large amounts of vitamin E. Vitamin E is very effective in the fading of scar tissue and improving the general condition of the skin</string>
			<string>The oil has a natural affinity with the skin. It is easily spread and absorbed quickly. Skin does not feel greasy after application.</string>
			<string>We use whole rice bran in our Herbalism cleanser for its powerful exfoliating action. It scrubs away dead surface matter, leaving your skin looking visibly refreshed.</string>

			<string>Our rose absolute comes from the flower petals of the Damask rose (Rosa damascena, from the plant family Rosaceae). It is obtained by solvent extraction. Other rose species can be used to produce rose oils and absolutes. Rose is thought to be the first floral. We also use rose oil from the same plant.</string>
			<string>We are one of the main buyers of rose absolute in the world.</string>
			<string>The Damask rose is grown across Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, India and China.</string>
			<string>Rose absolute is dark reddish brown in color and has a sweet, floral, rosy aroma. There are around 300 constituents in rose absolute, but some of the main ones are citronellol, geraniol and phenyl ethyl alcohol. This means the absolute has a complex aroma and many interesting properties.</string>
			<string>Rose is said to have been the first floral essential oil to be distilled.</string>
			<string>Rose absolute and rose oil are popular in perfumery and aromatherapy. Aromatherapists recommend rose for depression, sadness and grief. It is also believed to have a balancing effect on emotions. The scent of rose is considered an aphrodisiac. At the same time, it has been an ancient symbol of love and innocence.</string>
			<string>Rose absolute is a great ingredient for moisturizing products and it is good choice for mature, rough or irritated skins. We use this oil to help improve skin’s appearance and to perfume skin and hair.</string>
			<string>Our lovingly created, heart-shaped Tisty Tosty Bath Bomb contains rose absolute to soothe skin and relax a weary mind. To create a sense of well-being, we’ve also added it to our creamy Amandopondo Bubble Bar.</string>

			<string>Rose oil is also sometimes described as rose ‘otto’ or ‘attar,’ which comes from the Arabic word ‘utur,’ meaning perfume. Rose oil is extracted by steam distillation from the flower petals of the plant. It is more expensive than the absolute because steam distillation yields less oil.

			<string>In skincare, it has been favoured for mature skin. It is also used as a general skin tonic for all skin types, but particularly for rough, dry and irritated skins. It has been traditionally recommended for anyone suffering from the high color caused by thread veins.</string>
			<string>We have used rose oil in our Turkish Delight shower smoothie for its beautiful perfume and aphrodisiac effect.</string>
			<string>We have used rose otto in some of our Retro products, including Tiptoe Through the Tulips soap, Ginger fragrance, and Gingerman Bath Bomb. The otto is soothing and calming for the skin, as well as being beautifully fragrant and complex.</string>

			<string>Rose hip oil is obtained from the seeds of the wild rose bush, normally found in Chile.</string>
			<string>Cold-pressing ensures that the nutrient content of the seeds is preserved.</string>
			<string>It is believed that the Chileans fiercely guarded the secrets of rose hip oil before it was put to scientific testing to prove its efficacy on the skin.</string>
			<string>Rose hip oil has a high content of unsaturated, essential fatty acids, namely oleic (15-20%), linoleic (44-50%) and linolenic (30-35%). They are called ‘essential’ because our body is not able to reproduce them. They help to nourish and maintain a healthy skin.</string>
			<string>This oil is also very high in antioxidant vitamin C. Rose hip oil contains 20 times the vitamin C of an orange.</string>
			<string>The combination of the antioxidant vitamins and the fatty acids may contribute to a visible reduction in the appearance of stretch marks, scarring and hyper-pigmentation, when applied directly to the skin.</string>
			<string>Its regenerative qualities account for its widespread use in cosmetic surgery aftercare. The oil’s absorbency means it is easy to apply and can reach skin cells quickly, helping to treat damaged tissues.</string>
			<string>Rose hip oil is essential to the formation of collagen in the skin. Cosmetically, this is also proven to be useful for evening out skin tones and creating a smoothing effect on rough or dry skins.</string>

			<string>Sodium Chloride chloride is simply salt.</string>
			<string>Salt is stimulating, cleansing, antiseptic and astringent.</string>
			<string>It is softening for the skin and hydrates it when used in moderation.</string>
			<string>Salt is full of minerals. Minerals maintain the water balance essential for healthy life processes. They stabilize the pH levels of the blood and lymphatic system stable. Minerals neutralize wastes and prepare them for elimination.</string>
			<string>Salt is used in the production of our palm-free soap base.</string>
			<string>Cleansing the skin with soaps containing salt is an excellent way to benefit from this mineral content. The formula de-greases the skin, removing dead skin cells and dirt. It does this without stripping too much natural oil and leaves the skin soft and comfortable.</string>
			<string>Sodium chloride can be found in our range of soaps - from Bohemian and Miranda to Ice Blue.</string>
			<string>Fine sea salt (Sodium chloride) is harvested from the azure seawater by the shores of Spain, near Cadiz. Seawater is channelled into beds or pans and the water evaporates. This process takes three years and leaves behind crystallized salt.</string>
			<string>These salt crystals are free from pesticide waste, heavy metals and radioactivity. Their unrefined qualities ensure the full content of trace minerals is present. Fine grade sea salt means the crystals are ground to a small size. Sea salt is rich in sodium, magnesium and other minerals, all of which are found in seawater. Organic certification is in progress.</string>
			<string>Salt is stimulating, cleansing, antiseptic and astringent. It softens the skin and makes hair voluminous.</string>
			<string>Soft water makes hair go flat, but salt counteracts this effect. Soft water is generated in regions of hard, impervious rock. Containing no mineral reside, it is literally ‘soft.’</string>
			<string>We combine larger sea salt granules in solid shampoo products. When used with ingredients like Irish moss seaweed gel and nori seaweed, the effect on the hair is stunning. Hair is left with volume and great shine. When travelling to areas of soft water, a product like this will keep the hair full of bounce and volume.</string>
			<string>When salt is placed in a medium in which it can dissolve, it creates a solution, which can conduct an electric current. Salt is an electrolyte and thickens liquids. Minerals maintain the essential water balances. They do this by drawing chemical substances in and out of cells. Aided by vitamins and amino acids, they keep the pH of the blood and the lymphatic system stable.</string>
			<string>Surfactant or shampoo bases contain negatively charged particles or ‘ions.’ The salt solution affects these negatively charged ions, and causes them to re-arrange and thicken. The sea salt within the formulation gives the hair volume and softens the skin of the scalp or body making it an ideal ingredient for our Rub Rub Rub shower gel.</string>
			<string>Cleansing the skin with fine sea salt is an excellent way to benefit from this mineral content. The particles exfoliate, clean and soften the skin. A stimulating blend with fresh lime juice and grapefruit infusion is suitable for oily skin and used in our Ocean Salt scrub.</string>
			<string>Sea salt can be combined with soothing ingredients like calamine and aloe for dry skin. We use it in our Aqua Marina facial cleanser to cleanses the skin efficiently, and calms and softens, too.</string>

			<string>Sandalwood oil is extracted from the inner heartwood by steam distillation. It is valued in perfumery for its warm, woody and rich aroma, though these characteristics change depending on the oil’s origin.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists use sandalwood oil as soothing, anti-depressant and expectorant. The oil is both astringent and antiseptic, helping to clarify acne-prone skin.</string>
			<string>Sandalwood oil is highly valued in perfumery. We use it as a base note and fixative in our fragrances.</string>
			<string>Sandalwood oil is used in skincare preparations as an effective emollient. An emollient works to externally soothe and soften the skin. Sandalwood is classed as cooling and moisturizing, and is used for dry skin conditions caused by lack of moisture. It is helpful on very dry, uneven, aging and dehydrated skin, and it is said to reduce inflammation.</string>
			<string>Sandalwood has been very important in religious ceremonies and folk medicine since antiquity.</string>

			<string>The stems grow up to one metre high, clad in sticky hairs, with large, divided, lower leaves. In summer, capsules containing creamy white seeds follow off-white, bell-shaped flowers.</string>
			<string>Sesame was one of the earliest plants to be used by humans both for its seeds and oil. The seeds are collected when ripe and pressed for oil, ground into a paste or stored for decoctions.</string>
			<string>Sesame oil is yellow to amber in color and has a pleasant, mild, nutty aroma and flavor.</string>
			<string>The seeds contain sesamol, which is a natural preservative, so the oil pressed from them is very stable and highly resistant to oxidation.</string>
			<string>It is rich in monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and in lecithin. Sesame oil is used as a cooking oil and salad dressing.</string>
			<string>Medicinally, it is used internally for hair loss, stiff joints, coughs, and to treat the digestive system</string>
			<string>We use sesame seed oil in our Skin Drink moisturizer to rehydrate dry skin.</string>

			<string>It is a naturally occurring fat, derived from the nut of the Karite tree (Butyrospermum parkii). The tree is akin to an oak and usually grows wild. Though it is difficult to cultivate, its fruit kernels are famed for their ability to nourish – inside and out.</string>
			<string>Karite oil is used for cooking; the butter is used for cosmetics.</string>
			<string>We trade directly with the women who hand-process the butter using traditional methods. This ensures that we get the best quality product and they get the best deal. We believe ‘fair trade’ should mean something.</string>
			<string>The butter was a valuable commodity during Cleopatra’s reign. It has a high lipid profile, also containing beneficial phytochemicals (vitamin A). It also contains oleic acid (omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid).</string>
			<string>Compounds within the butter have been shown to offer some protection from the effects of UVB rays.</string>
			<string>Oleic acid is highly compatible with human skin and with the sebum we naturally produce to protect our skin’s surface. It absorbs readily and aids the absorption of other active ingredients.</string>
			<string>Shea butter is moisturizing, emollient and softening on skin and it’s so gentle that it has been traditionally used in Africa for baby massage.</string>
			<string>We use the nourishing butter in our Cosmetic Lad and Imperialis moisturizers for its emollient properties and vitamin content.</string>

			<string>Agar Agar comes from a species of seaweeds classed as &apos;agarophytes.&apos; These are found in the seas of Japan, the Mediterranean, Europe, America and Africa.</string>
			<string>They possess fine-fronds, giving them a tufted appearance, which also branch into solid segments. Their colors vary from pinks to deep reds and purples. These colors camouflage their chlorophyll.</string>
			<string>When the seaweeds are collected, they are then laid out on a beach, bleached and dried. To obtain the gel like solution, the seaweed is boiled in water and filtered. This is then dried in the sunlight and prepared into bars, flakes or fine granules. </string>
			<string>Japanese innkeeper, Minoya Tarozaemon, first encountered Agar in 1660. These types of &apos;agarophyte&apos; seaweeds have been cultivated in Japan since 1769.</string>
			<string>Agar has been used as a culture medium for bacteria since the 1880s, when Robert Koch discovered its usefulness. It is used in the food industry, medicine, dentistry and forensics. </string>
			<string>A teaspoon of agar powder will create a jelly from a cup of liquid. This gel is softening and moisturizing for both skin and hair. </string>
			<string>We use agar agar gel in our Retread triple-strength hair conditioner, which holds together the other ingredients to revitalize damaged, colored, frizzy and thick curly hair.</string>
			<string>Seaweeds contain up to twenty times the elements of land plants.</string>
			<string>We suspend clays and exfoliating granules in the gel-like structure of agar for our Love Lettuce Fresh Face Mask. The gel softens the skin, balancing the cleansing action of the other ingredients. </string>
			<string>In the creamy Veganese conditioner, we use the gel for its softening action on the hair follicles. It also acts as a thickening agent in the product.</string>

			<string>In 1846, John Dwight and his brother-in-law, Dr Austin Church, invented Bicarbonate bicarbonate of soda. It was made from carbon dioxide and treated soda ash. Combined with cream of tartar, it makes the texture of cake and bread lighter. These two products form baking powder.</string>
			<string>Bicarbonate of soda is very soothing, used for insect bites, eczema, and minor sunburn. It also calms indigestion and heartburn, and it is used for kidney complaints as well. It is being used to help neutralize acidic gases, which is helping to improve the environment.</string>
			<string>Sodium bicarbonate softens the water and promotes circulation. These properties make it an excellent ingredient for our Bath Bombs. In combination with citric acid – and hot water, of course – carbon dioxide is created. This appears as fizzing, whizzing bubbles. Bath Bombs are fantastically popular and they must be one of the greatest phenomena to hit the cosmetic industry for many decades. These include Avobath, Geo Phyzz, Sex Bomb, and Pink. We are the proud inventors of the Bath Bomb.</string>
			<string>This simple combination of ingredients is very versatile. Different colors and fragrances can be added. We use flowers, fruits, herbs, different types of salt, and seaweed, to name but a few. There are many favourites: Big Blue, Blackberry, Tisty Tosty, Honey Bee and Butterball.</string>
			<string>Essential oils are particularly effective in Bath Bombs. The fizzing bubbles heighten the effects of the essential oils as they envelope the senses.</string>
			<string>Sodium bicarbonate is part of the mixture that makes our innovative, exclusive bubble bars. In combination with a shampoo base, a paste-like texture is formed. With this very versatile paste, we can make an endless variety of different shapes. We can then add as many natural ingredients as we like. Our Bubble Bars were invented with the belief that bath bubbles should be big, frothy and voluminous, rather than the weak, thin ones we found in other products.</string>
			<string>Sodium bicarbonate is used in every one of our Bubble Bars, including The Comforter, Amandopondo, Blue Skies, and Creamy Candy.</string>
			<string>We use sodium bicarbonate with soft absorbent powders and finely ground herbs – such as sage, rosemary, tea tree and lycopodium – in our Greeench deodorant. A deodorant powder like this is very easy to apply and will not stretch or pull the skin. Alongside these powders, we have used anti-microbial tea tree oil to keep bacteria under control.</string>

			<string>Sodium borate is a colorless, crystalline powder. It is the mineral salt of boric acid. This inorganic salt has been used in the cosmetic industry since the 1900s.</string>
			<string>It was once used to give semi-permanent curls to the hair. It can alter a product’s pH, act as a preservative and soften water. In bath salts, it is a mild detergent.</string>
			<string>We use sodium borate in formulas with beeswax. These compounds react with each other to form a water-in-oil emulsion. This neutralizes the sodium borate and effectively leaves none of it in the final product. The cream that is then formed has a rich emollient texture because of the effect of the beeswax. It deeply softens the skin and lifts dirt away from the surface, leaving it clean and soft. This is essentially a cold cream, akin to the Greek physician Galen’s in the second century.</string>
			<string>Galen’s cold cream mixed beeswax and olive oil with water (or rose water) beaten into it. Because it cooled the skin, it became known as cold cream.</string>
			<string>Borax was added to the basic combination of ingredients at the end of the nineteenth century. It reacts with fatty acids in the beeswax to form an emulsion and makes the cream stable.</string>
			<string>Our Ultra Bland cleanser follows the basic principles of Galen’s cold cream. The emulsion melts onto the skin, loosening and picking up dirt and dead skin cells. This is an incredibly gentle way to cleanse the skin and will not irritate skin or destroy its natural protective barrier. In Ultra Bland, we&apos;ve used beeswax, borax, peanut oil and rose water as the basic emulsion, and we’ve combined it with glycerine and fresh iris extract to get the cooling, gently cleansing effect Galen pioneered.</string>
			<string>We have used sodium borate in our range of lip balms to form an emulsion with beeswax, creating a protective barrier on the lips. Our Whipstick and Honey Trap lip balms all contain sodium borate.</string>

			<string>Sodium cocoamphoacetate is an organic compound derived from coconut oil. Vegetable oils are made up of fatty acids, occurring in enormous quantities in nature. Coconut oil is a very important raw material for sections of the chemical industry. It can easily be split and used to produce soaps, esters and amides. These become surfactants such as betaines, cationics, amphoterics or sulphosuccinates.</string>
			<string>Sodium cocoamphoacetate is a foam stabilizer, hair conditioner and a surfactant (surface active agent). It is a mild ingredient suitable for use in cleansing products.</string>
			<string>Sodium cocoamphoacetate is a mild surfactant, foam booster, stabilizer and a hair-conditioning ingredient. It is used in our shower gels, cleansers and hair products to improve the quality and stability of foam, making it last longer in the presence of oil and dirt. It also supports the action of the primary surfactant, which helps the removal of oil-based dirt and debris.</string>
			<string>Foam boosters also increase the surface tension of the liquid that surrounds individual bubbles, resulting in foam that doesn’t just disappear!</string>
			<string>Sodium cocoamphoacetate is useful in face cleansers, scrubs and shaving creams because of its mildness and ability to add slip to the formula, making the product glide smoothly on skin.</string>
			<string>Modern surfactants give thick, rich foam and cleanse the hair leaving it feeling very clean. This thorough action dissolves dirt and grease effectively. Hair is left full of shine and in great condition.</string>
			<string>We use sodium cocoamphoacetate across our entire range of shower gels, including Rub, Rub, Rub, The Olive Branch, Flying Fox and Happy Hippy. Sodium cocoamphoacetate helps to clean your entire body, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed.</string>

			<string>Sorbitol is a sweetener used in many food products. It can either be in a crystalline or liquid form. We use it in Toothy Tabs in a crystalline form as it combines well with the other powdered ingredients, such as Sodium Bicarbonate.</string>
			<string>Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol or polyol. It occurs naturally in many fruits and berries. It was originally identified in the berries of a tree called the mountain ash, by a French chemist in 1872.</string>
			<string>It is presently produced commercially by the hydrogenation of glucose. Despite its source, it does not produce dental cavities.</string>
			<string>Sorbitol gives a sweet flavor but is also a good texturizing agent and humectant. It gives a smooth feel in the mouth and tastes cool and pleasant. The qualities make it an excellent ingredient to use in the Toothy Tabs. Its presence gives better flavor and texture. The crystalline grade used helps reduce the moisture content of the Toothy Tabs enabling the manufacturing process to be accomplished without baking the powder blend too much. This preserves the flavor and texture, protecting against loss of moisture content.</string>
			<string>Sorbitol is used in chewing gums, sweets, frozen desserts, biscuits, as well as pharmaceuticals and health care products. It is widely used in toothpaste and mouthwashes. It has been used for fifty years as a safe synthetic.</string>

			<string>Soya lecithin is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in eggs, whole grains and legumes (which include soybeans, peas and alfalfa). Lecithin was first isolated by Maurice Gobley in 1850 from egg yolk and named after it (Greek ‘lekithos,’meaning ‘yolk of egg’).</string>
			<string>It is a vital, structural, cell membrane component of living organisms, and it is produced naturally in the body.</string>
			<string>Most commercial lecithin now comes from soya bean, from which it was obtained in the 1930s.</string>
			<string>In nutrition, egg was long a mystery to researchers because it is very high in cholesterol, but eating them in moderation didn&apos;t seem to significantly increase cholesterol blood levels. This was until lecithin in the egg was found to help prevent cholesterol from attaching itself to the walls of blood vessels. There are many health claims about lecithin as a supplement - from helping against neurological conditions to improving liver function.</string>
			<string>Maurice Gobley identified it as the substance that allows oil and water to mix - which makes lecithin unusual in that it&apos;s a naturally occurring surfactant (surface-active agent).</string>
			<string>Surfactants, also known as tensides or wetting agents, are substances used to lower the surface tension of a liquid, which then allows easier spreading of product and helps to emulsify it (blend two ingredients that would otherwise separate, such as water and oil). For this reason, lecithin is a highly valuable ingredient in cosmetics and is also widely used in the food industry to help improve the texture of baked goods, sauces and processed foods, such as margarine and chocolate.</string>
			<string>When applied in a cosmetic product, lecithin also softens the skin and helps the absorption of other ingredients.</string>
			<string>It is a highly conditioning and moisturizing ingredient for hair, which is why it&apos;s used in so many of our hair conditioners and masks. Soya lecithin is used in our Marilyn and Hair Doctor hair treatments to condition and create really shiny hair.</string>
			<string>Adding a natural surfactant to the formula also reduces the need for synthetic ingredients and allows for more sophisticated blends of raw materials.</string>
			<string>We use soya lecithin as an emulsifier and surfactant in Trichomania solid shampoo bar and Jungle solid conditioner.</string>

			<string>Although unconfirmed, it is believed that the plant derives from a Chinese legume: Glycine ussuriensis. The plant can grow up to two metres in height with self-fertilizing flowers. Most commercial varieties have brown seeds with four seeds per pod.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soya has been eaten and cultivated in China since 2,800B.C. and it was considered one of the five essentials for living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the 18th century, missionaries sent soya beans back to Europe; one of the earliest widespread uses of the bean was a cheap source of protein during the First World War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, USA is the main grower of soya and over 90% of the crop is used for animal feed. A whole soya industry has developed around the bean and various materials derived from it are widespread today e.g. Miso, soy sauce, tamari, tempeh, T.V.P. and tofu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soya oil is processed from the shelled seeds of soya; it is a clear, bright, pale-yellow liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soya oil is made up mainly of linoleic (omega 6) and oleic (omega 9) acids. It also contains some linolenic (omega 3) and saturated fatty acids. It is used primarily as cooking oil and to make margarine, but it has several other commercially valuable uses. There are some studies showing that consuming soya oil could be a good alternative to fish oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In cosmetics, soya oil acts as an antioxidant and it also conditions hair and skin.</string>
			<string>We have used soya oil in our Jasmine and Henna Frizz-Eaze hair treatment for its deeply conditioning qualities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soya oil has a rich, moisturizing texture.

			<string>Spearmint oil (Mentha Viridisviridis) belongs to the Labiatae plant family.</string>
			<string>It is extracted from the flowering tops of the plant by steam distillation.</string>
			<string>This herb grows up to approximately 3 feet tall with green leaves and pink or purple flowers.</string>
			<string>It is native to the Mediterranean and has a sweet, mint-like aroma. We use Chinese Spearmint spearmint oil.</string>
			<string>Spearmint oil is used to flavour chewing gum, toothpaste, sweets, and to modify peppermint, which is then known as doublemint.</string>
			<string>In perfumery, spearmint is used in blends with lavender and jasmine. It is popular as a soap perfume and we have used this mint in our Demon in the Dark soap.</string>

			<string>Water can dissolve the mineral content in the rocks it flows over. Rain and melted snow filter through soil and permeable rock until they are stopped by an impervious rock such as granite.</string>
			<string>Water percolates through rock strata, collecting different minerals. Limestone enriches water with calcium; water from the dolomites is rich in magnesium; and volcanic rocks are rich in sodium. Mineral waters emerge as pure springs. These processes create spring water.</string>
			<string>History suggests water has been extracted from chalk below the ground since Roman times.</string>
			<string>Though water is important in cosmetics, we are experts at making products that do not contain water, such as our solid shampoos and bubble bars. Our Fresh Face Masks control water content, establishing microbiological quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Water is an essential for every living system. Today, medical professionals everywhere tout the importance of water. Drinking water helps to flush out toxins in the body and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</string>
			<string>Spring water contains vital minerals. Minerals maintain the water balance essential for healthy life processes. They do this by drawing chemical substances in and out of cells. Minerals balance the pH levels of the blood, balance the nervous system and neutralize wastes. By using spring water in our products we are allowing all these miraculous properties to benefit the skin.</string>
			<string>We use spring water in our Breath Of Fresh Air facial toner water, where its refreshing quality enlivens the senses and brings necessary minerals directly to the skin. The combined qualities of both the mineral content of the spring water and essential oils make our skin toners really effective and beneficial to the skin.</string>

			<string>There are two types of almond (sweet and bitter), but we use the sweet one. The almond is a fruit and a part of the plum family. The almond tree is a medium-sized tree, native to the Middle East and North Africa. Its white blossom is captivating and beautiful, inspiring many legends.</string>
			<string>Ancient Egyptians valued the almond for cosmetic purposes. The ancient Greeks and Romans used to eat almonds to counter the effect of alcohol.</string>
			<string>When crushed and infused in water, almonds yield lovely milk, which is created as the almond oil combines with the water. Traditionally, almond milk was used as a drink to treat inflammation of the skin from the inside out.</string>
			<string>Our almonds originate in the warmth of California, one of the largest almond growing areas in the world.</string>
			<string>The almonds themselves have to undergo several different processes. They are shelled and sorted into groups of those suitable enough to become oil. They are processed into crude oil and different grades of refined oil are then produced.</string>
			<string>Almond crops are very susceptible to weather, achieving larger quantities in sunny climates. The trees themselves don&apos;t produce almonds for the first three or four years of their lives and will be productive until around twenty-five years. To produce the almonds, the flowers need to be pollinated and many of the producers keep beehives to encourage this.</string>
			<string>Almond milk is excellent when used to soften and moisturize. We use almond milk in our Celestial skin cream for just this purpose; it makes the skin feel beautifully soft and nourished.</string>

			<string>Sugar cane is a tropical and subtropical grass. Its long stems grow tall and produce blade-like leaves and clusters of white flowers. The juice of the cane is high in sucrose. It is processed on site into unrefined sugar, and in certain areas, the juice is boiled down to make a molasses-like brown sugar called jaggery.</string>
			<string>Most of today’s refined sugar is produced from sugar cane. It was the first cultivated crop for sugar production.</string>
			<string>Many other types of sugar exist - for example, fructose (fruit sugar) and lactose (milk sugar), but we usually commonly use the word ‘sugar’ to refer to sucrose.</string>
			<string>Sugar was first widely used in India, whereas honey and dried fruits, such as figs and dates were the usual sweeteners elsewhere.</string>
			<string>In India, sugar was thought to have near-magical healing properties and it was prescribed for longevity and fertility. The Romans knew of sugar, but found it curious.</string>

			<string>Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) was first described in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as “the forbidden fruit.” It is a hybrid between an orange and a pomelo (Citrus grandis). Sweetie oil is a type of grapefruit oil, produced from a grapefruit and pomelo hybrid.</string>
			<string>Grapefruit belongs to the Rutaceae plant family. It is a large evergreen fruit tree that originates from Jamaica. It can grow up to 9m tall and can produce around 500 fruits per year.</string>
			<string>Most of the world’s grapefruits are produced in USA, particularly in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona. They are also cultivated in Tropical Asia and West Indies. The sweetie variety is mostly cultivated in Israel. It was produced to be much sweeter than traditional grapefruit, hence the name. It is also sometimes referred to as oroblanco.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists use grapefruit oil as a refreshing and tonic fragrance; it reminds us of the sun’s energy and can help perk up a dull morning. It’s popular for lifting the mood and has been used extensively to treat stress, depression and even Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.), which can strike during dark winter months.</string>
			<string>Sweetie fruits are large, round and bright green. They have a thicker rind than that of the grapefruit. The oil is extracted from the peel by cold expression and it is pale yellow with a sweet citrus aroma.</string>
			<string>Grapefruit oil is used by aromatherapists as antiseptic, astringent and antibacterial oil for conditions such as acne and congested, oily skin. Sweetie oil is a fairly new product, but it is used interchangeably with grapefruit oil.</string>
			<string>Grapefruit and sweetie oils are also popular as top notes in fine fragrances. We use sweetie oil in our product perfumes and fine fragrances. We’ve added it to the retro World Piece Bath Bomb.</string>

			<string>There are several varieties of the tagetes plant and the tagetes oil we use is distilled from the flowering stems and leaves of T. minuta, also sometimes called Mexican marigold, Inca marigold or Peruvian black mint.</string>
			<string>It grows up to 2 metres tall and produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Native to South America, it was introduced to Europe during the Spanish conquests.</string>
			<string>Tagetes minuta is a popular companion plant in gardening, because its roots produce a compound, which keeps slugs, pests and weeds at bay.</string>
			<string>In Peru, minuta is known as ‘huacatay’ and made into puree and seasoning that give local dishes a unique herbal flavor. It is said to taste like a mixture of mint, coriander and basil. It has been used this way since the ancient Inca civilization.</string>
			<string>Tagetes belongs to the same family of plants as the dahlia and daisy (Asteraceae) and shouldn&apos;t be confused with Calendula officinalis, which is also commonly referred to as marigold.</string>
			<string>Tagetes oil is used to flavour food, tobacco, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks, including cola. It is a popular ingredient in perfumery, and we sometimes use it in our fragrances.</string>
			<string>The compounds naturally present in the oil have been shown to act as antimicrobial and antifungal agents. This makes tagetes oil not only useful as an aromatic material, but perfect for our low preservative cosmetics and right at home in hand, body and foot lotions.</string>
			<string>Our Charity Pot hand and body lotion contain tagetes oil as part of its fresh fragrances.</string>

			<string>A naturally occurring mineral, talc is a hydrated magnesium silicate, also known as French chalk or magnesium silicate. It is soft and breaks into small flakes. Cosmetic talc is milled and purified.</string>
			<string>Ancient Egyptians used talc blended with clays and other materials to make carvings and ornaments.</string>
			<string>It’s one of the most common ingredients of face powder and other powder-based color cosmetics.</string>
			<string>Talc has been used in cosmetics for decades as an absorbent, bulking agent and to give make-up a smooth, silky feel.</string>
			<string>Talc has many industrial applications from manufacture of ceramics to its use in paper-making.</string>
			<string>There have been various worries about use of talc in cosmetic products. These have all been thoroughly researched and there is no evidence to support concerns. The only cautionary measure talc requires is the same one that applies to any fine powder: when presented in a loose powder form, inhaling large amounts (more than during typical cosmetic use) could be harmful to lungs.</string>

			<string>The Calophyllum inophyllum trees originate from Southeast Asia and are plentiful on the islands of the South Pacific, where the timber and oil have been used by the Polynesians for thousands of years.</string>
			<string>The tamanu grows clusters of beautifully scented white flowers, which mature into round fruits that contain tough kernels. Once the fruits have fallen to the ground, they are harvested, and the kernels are removed.</string>
			<string>The trees are grown without chemicals. The pale-colored nuts are sun-dried for four weeks, and they deepen in color to a rich dark brown and begin to ooze with oil. The nuts are then cold-pressed to extract the tamanu oil.</string>
			<string>The Pacific islanders have used many parts of the tree as natural remedies. They made an infusion of the leaves to treat inflammations, rashes, infections and sore eyes - and the oil from the nuts has been used to treat the skin.</string>
			<string>The oil has been traditionally used to ease aching joints and to soothe and smooth dry skin and sunburn. Tamanu oil has been well researched since at least the 1950s and some of its constituents may explain why it has been recommended for problem skins and has a reputation for being beneficial for wound healing.</string>
			<string>One of these constituents is calophyllolide, which has been found to be anti-inflammatory. Other phytochemical components of the oil have been shown to be anti-bacterial. The oil is also rich in oleic and linoleic fatty acids, which moisturize and soften skin.</string>

			<string>Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) is a small tree belonging to the myrtle (Myrtaceae) family and it is native to Australasia.</string>
			<string>It is thought that the taxonomical name melaleuca was given after the tree’s trunk had been charred black by a bushfire. Melaleuca is derived from the Greek ‘melas’ (meaning black) and ‘leucos’ (meaning white). The tree’s trunk, branches and flowers are actually white - and it is known as one of the so-called paperbark trees because its bark peels back in paper-like layers.</string>
			<string>The common name is accredited to the British explorer Captain Cook who is reported to have boiled the leaves into a tea-like drink, which he gave to his men in the hope that it would prevent scurvy.</string>
			<string>The aboriginal tribes had been using the leaves of this plant as a medicinal tea and traditional remedy for years. The foliage contains an abundance of aromatic essential oils. Some of the paperbark varieties are exploited commercially for the high germicidal value of the leaves and oil extracted from them.</string>
			<string>The bark has been used for roofing, corking ships, and for lining baskets. Aboriginal women are said to have traditionally used this bark to wrap their children in, which acted as a kind of antiseptic protection against chills and bacteria.</string>
			<string>Tea tree leaves are collected and steam-distilled locally. The oil smells warm, spicy, and fresh. The leaves that yield tea tree oil are themselves useful for keeping hair and skin clear and blemish-free.</string>
			<string>Tea tree oil is made up of around 100 substances, including terpenes, mostly considered to be responsible for tea tree oil’s reputation as a remedy. The oil has been scientifically proven to be antibacterial, antifungal and particularly effective against the types of fungi we call yeasts.</string>
			<string>Our best selling Dream Cream contains tea tree oil as just one of the many caring and beneficial ingredients to help calm the skin.</string>
			<string>We combined tea tree oil with fresh garlic in Cosmetic Warrior Fresh Face Mask, which is a powerful combination. Both ingredients are bactericidal and antiseptic, helping to keep your skin clear.</string>

			<string>Tonka absolute is obtained from the seeds of the fruit of the Dipteryx odorata tree. This tall tree belongs to the legume (Fabaceae) plant family. It can grow up to 120 feet tall and has black fruits. The trees can be found in Costa Rica, Brazil and Peru.</string>
			<string>Once the fruit is ripe, the seeds are removed and soaked in alcohol. They swell up, after which they are removed and dried out. As they dry, a white frost appears on the surface. This was first identified in 1820 as coumarin.</string>
			<string>At room temperature, the absolute is solid, brown and has a sweet, vanilla-like aroma.</string>
			<string>Tonka absolute is a valued perfumery material and we use it in our Vanillary solid perfume.</string>
			<string>Aromatherapists use tonka as antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory. It is also thought to treat joint problems.</string>
			<string>We use tonka to complement the vanilla absolute in our Vanilla Fountain Bath Bomb for lasting fragrance on the skin.</string>
			<string>We also use tonka bean in our Heavanilli massage bar, which is part of our Vanillary range for an indulgent, caramel-scented massage.</string>

			<string>Vanilla beans (pods) are the dried unripe fruits the orchid Vanilla planifolia. Every flower is pollinated by hand and each blossom produces a single bean that is normally harvested after 8/9 months. The unripe beans are picked when yellowish in color and are boiled in water for 3 minutes.</string>
			<string>They are then dried slowly over the next 3 to 4 months in the sun. Each day, they are exposed to sunlight for 2 hours, then covered in blankets and taken in at night to allow the chemical process to take place. The beans shrivel, become flexible, and turn a very dark color.</string>
			<string>We use vanilla pods from South America and the West Indies.</string>
			<string>Vanilla pods and vanillin extracted from them are used as flavouring in cakes, ice creams and custards.</string>
			<string>Vanilla absolute, resinoid and vanillin are popular perfume ingredients and are heavily used in aromatherapy.</string>
			<string>Vanilla pods are made up of sugars, vanillin, fats and mineral salts. When applied topically, the sugars in vanilla act as a humectant. The humectant action also forms a barrier on skin, which prevents moisture loss. Vanillin is the main source of the characteristic vanilla scent and it has also been shown to have antioxidant properties.</string>
			<string>Vanilla absolute is extracted from the beans of the plant. It is a thick brown substance that has a very sweet, vanilla aroma that is widely used as flavoring in foods and in cosmetics.</string>

			<string>Water is often the first item on a Quantitative Ingredients list, and it is sometimes thought of as the &apos;profit margin&apos; for a product. We have to declare the name &apos;Aqua&apos; by law.We are experts at making products that do not contain water and have created many innovations (solid shampoo, conditioners and Bubble Bars). Our work in Fresh Face Masks involved controlling water content to establish microbiological quality, therefore, we know how difficult it is to formulate without it.</string>
			<string>Water is the basis of life. The Sumarians called water, &apos;A&apos; which meant ‘generative force.’ For thousands of years, water, whether in the form of rain or rivers, has been highly valued and worshipped. There are sacred springs in all countries.&lt;br&gt; </string>
			<string>Water is an active agent that can dissolve some of the minerals from the rocks it flows over. Rain and melted snow filter through soil and permeable rock until they reach impervious rock such as granite. Water can be described as ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ because of the characteristics it develops from the geology it flows through.</string>
			<string>Soft water is ‘soft’ because it is generated in regions of hard, impervious rock. It does not contain any mineral residue. On the other hand, ‘hard’ water is caused by calcium and magnesium ions dissolved in water from calcium and magnesium salts taken up from limestone and dolomite. These are quite soft rocks compared to granite. The hardness and softness of water have implications for cosmetics because different types of water affect hair in different ways.</string>
			<string>Water catches ions of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other minerals, which nourish the interior of our skin cells. Water from cosmetic products is absorbed by the skin and travels to the deeper layers. Softening the upper layers with emollient ingredients, such as cocoa butter, stops water from escaping out again.</string>
			<string>A positive way to start the day is to re-energize with a shower. The negative ions in the moving water provide a feeling of energy. Shower products blend their water content with our other effective ingredients to create a softening, cleansing effect on skin and hair.</string>
			<string>In 1783, an English physicist, Henry Cavendish, discovered that an electric spark induces hydrogen and oxygen to combine and produce water. In 1805, de Humboldt and Gay-Lussac showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen. The physical nature of water was established.</string>
			<string>Living creatures cannot live without water and there is a greater awareness today of the importance of drinking it. Water regulates body temperature and eliminates waste stored in the tissues quickly and easily. Drinking plenty of water is an excellent way to cleanse the body, which helps keep skin clear and beautiful. When you consider that it is quite normal to lose 600ml to 800ml, it becomes apparent how important water is to the normal functioning of the body.</string>

			<string>Our wheat germ oil is cold-pressed from the germ (embryo) of the wheat kernel (Triticum vulgare).</string>
			<string>‘Germ’ is a reference to germination; the wheat plant grows from this bud, which makes up 2-3 percent of the whole grain. During germination, the starchy material surrounding the kernel is used as food.</string>
			<string>Wholegrain is lauded as a health food because nutrients from the wheat germ are included. Processed white wheat flour has few nutrients.</string>
			<string>Wheat is one of the oldest cultivated plants and its history can be traced back 10,000 years. Wheat crops became very important to the Romans; as their empire grew, so did the spread of wheat as a food staple.</string>
			<string>During the Dark Ages, only the rich could afford wheat. It only became widely affordable around the 19th century. In the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, European colonists heading for America brought wheat and other grains with them. Today, wheat is grown in almost every country.</string>
			<string>Wheat germ oil is yellow or reddish in colour with a nutty taste and it is nutritionally one of the densest substances in the plant world.</string>

			<string>The cacao tree (Theobroma cacao – ‘food of the gods’) is native to tropical America and can grow up to about 30-feet tall. The fruits produced are ripe, dark reddish-brown pods, which yield 20-50 seeds, which are known as cocoa beans.</string>
			<string>Chocolate is made by fermenting these seeds to remove their bitter taste. They are then cleaned, sorted, roasted and cracked to remove their hard shells, resulting in ‘cocoa nibs’. These ‘cocoa nibs’ are ground into a thick, oily paste called chocolate liquor, which is then blended to the desired consistency of the chocolate manufacturer.</string>
			<string>The fat removed from the chocolate liquor is called cocoa butter. With the fat separated, the remaining liquor becomes cocoa powder, which can be mixed with other ingredients to make confections and drinks.</string>
			<string>Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, a chemical our brain manufactures when we are happy or in love.</string>
			<string>Chocolate is an inspiration for cosmetics. Its colour, texture and smell are used to create products to stimulate the senses and soften the skin - without increasing waist size! </string>
			<string>We use white chocolate if the colour and the inspiration of white chocolate is needed. Our Mange Too Massage Bar contains white chocolate for a creamy and sensual tactile experience.</string>

			<string>Oat grass (Avena sativa) has been cultivated for its edible grain crop for thousands of years. Oat seeds dating back to 2000 years have been found in Egypt, although, these were probably from wild oats. Cultivation as a food crop started in Europe around the Bronze Age and then spread throughout the world. Oats tolerate cold climate very well and some of the major commercial producers are USA, Canada, Belarus, Finland, Poland and Germany. </string>
			<string>The Roman historian, Pliny, and his contemporaries, mention the use of oats as a topical, skin-soothing treatment in the medical texts of their time. Oats, and the extracts made from them, became popular in cosmetics after information was published in the 1930s about the ability of oats to relieve itching and to protect skin.</string>
			<string>Used widely as animal feed, oats are also a highly nutritious and popular food source for us. Oat grain in its natural state takes a long time to cook, and oat flakes, which are rolled, flattened and flaked to make them more convenient to prepare, are now very popular. Rolled oats infused in water produce a, cooling and calming liquid known as oat milk.</string>
			<string>While we are probably most familiar with oats cooked into porridge, oats are also used in savoury dishes, cereals and cakes. Ancient Romans recognized the beneficial properties, both externally and internally, and there are mentions of the nutritional and health benefits of oats in many Roman writings of the time. </string>
			<string>Oats are a source of calcium, iron and vitamin B1. They are high in carbohydrates and contain more protein and lipids (fat) than other grains. Oats also contain avenanthramides, a type of antibiotic produced by the plant, which act as an antioxidant and may contribute to the topical soothing effect of the grain. Cosmetic and medicinal preparations containing oats and oat extracts have been shown to be anti-inflammatory, to relieve itchy, irritated skin and to help with allergic reactions as oats are antihistamic.</string>
			<string>Old remedies for using whole oats and oat milk include poultices pressed directly onto sore skin and colloidal oat treatments made from infusing oats in water and using the resulting starchy liquid to soothe itchy, dry or sensitive skin. Doctors may recommend oatmeal baths for the treatment of infants with skin problems.</string>
			<string>We’ve put whole oats inside the muslin bag of loveliness that is our Ceridwen’s Cauldron bath melt. A traditional way of enjoying the effects of oats, the skin is left softened and nourished.</string>

			<string>Hamamelis is the botanical name for four shrubs that grow wild in the temperate regions of North America and East Asia. The common witch hazel is native to North America with oval, jagged leaves that look like the leaves of hazel plants (no relation). It is thought that this may be how witch hazel got its name.</string>
			<string>It produces clusters of vivid yellow flowers in the autumn, appearing while the previous year’s seedpods are reaching maturity. The pods contain two black and glossy seeds. Native Americans ate these, but collecting them can be an occupational hazard. When ripe, they explode from the shell.</string>
			<string>Hamamelis virginiana is the source of medicinally important Hamamelis water (also labelled witch hazel).</string>
			<string>The leaves branches and twigs are collected at various times throughout the year. They are dried, blended with alcohol for tinctures, or steamed for distillates. They are used for many healing and soothing preparations.</string>
			<string>Native Americans used the plant to stop bleeding, soothe itchy skin and bites and for eye irritations. In the 1800s, Theron T. Pond made witch hazel extract widely available in America as a commercial preparation. It became known as pond’s extract.</string>
			<string>Witch hazel is often used in eye drops and anti-inflammatory preparations today. It has excellent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. It is a powerful astringent.</string>
			<string>Make-up artists have been known to use a brand of haemorrhoid gel (it is 50% witch hazel), blended with other ingredients, to reduce puffiness. (A little distressing, we know.)</string>
			<string>The potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action of witch hazel is one of the protective elements of our Prince Triple Blossom shaving cream.</string>
			<string>We make our witch hazel infusion by steeping witch hazel leaves in hot boiled water, then adding it to our freshly made cosmetics.</string>
